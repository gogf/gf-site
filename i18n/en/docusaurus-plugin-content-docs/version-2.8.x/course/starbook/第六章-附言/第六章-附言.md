## Further Learning Directions and Suggestions
---
In all the development features of this book, the author has reserved some space for business optimization. Why not give it a try?
- Further use of middleware, adding post-middleware, customizing error messages;
- Incorporating `Jwtkey` into `config.yaml` instead of storing it directly in the code;
- Implementing blacklist and whitelist mechanisms for `JWT`;
- No validation performed on data when adding/editing a word, such as the word mastery level.

While optimizing these businesses, you will need to consult a large number of related documents. In this process, you will deepen your understanding of `GoFrame` and even `Golang`.
