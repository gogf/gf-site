description: "In the process of completing the registration interface using GoFrame, we learned to install database drivers, generate data models, interact with the database through DAO, write API files, use gf gen ctrl to generate controllers, and methods of interface parameter validation and internationalization processing, mastering the business logic connection between the Controller layer and the Logic layer."

In this chapter, we completed a registration interface using `GoFrame`. We initially got in touch with `GoFrame` and learned the following:

- Installing database drivers;
- Using `gf gen dao` to generate data models;
- Interacting with the database using `dao` calling `GoFrame ORM`;
- Writing `api` files and using `gf gen ctrl` to generate controllers;
- The `Controller` layer calls the `Logic` layer to complete business logic;
- Interface parameter validation and `i18n`.
