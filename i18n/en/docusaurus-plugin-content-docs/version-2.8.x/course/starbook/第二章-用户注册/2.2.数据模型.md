description: "Create a data table named users in the database to store user information, including fields such as username and password, supporting auto-increment primary key identification. By modifying configuration files and executing GF-CLI commands, generate data models and data access objects. The generated four files in the model and dao layers are responsible for managing data structures and data access. The GoFrame framework operates on the data table through ORM."

## Establish Data Table
---
Execute the following `sql` statement in your database to create a data table named `users` to store user information.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  password CHAR(32) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100),
  created_at DATETIME,
  updated_at DATETIME
);
```

| Field Name   | Type             | Description                        |
| ------------ | --------------   | -----------------------------      |
| `id`         | `INT UNSIGNED`   | Primary key, auto-increment, uniquely identifies the user   |
| `username`   | `VARCHAR(50)`    | Username, cannot be null            |
| `password`   | `CHAR(32)`       | User password hash value, fixed length of 32 characters, cannot be null |
| `email`      | `VARCHAR(100)`   | User's email address, can be null   |
| `created_at` | `DATETIME`       | Creation time                      |
| `updated_at` | `DATETIME`       | Record last update time            |
## Generate Data Model
---
Modify the tool configuration file:

*hack/config.yaml*
```yaml
gfcli:
  gen:
    dao:
      - link: "mysql:root:12345678@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/star"
```

> Do not confuse `hack/config.yaml` with `manifest/config/config.yaml`; the former is a configuration file for development tools, while the latter is for business configuration.

Execute the `GF-CLI` command to generate the data model:
```bash
$ gf gen dao
```

Upon successful execution, four files will be generated in the `model` and `dao` layers:
```text
internal/model/do/users.go
internal/model/entity/users.go
internal/dao/internal/users.go
internal/dao/users.go
```

The `model` layer is used by `GoFrame` to manage data structures, corresponding one-to-one with the data table, and should not be modified by users. `model/do/users.go` is used as a data writing object, adopting a generic design for easy data storage; `model/entity/users.go` is used as a data reading object, with types consistent with the data table.

The `dao` layer manages data access objects, with `GoFrame ORM` using it to perform CRUD operations on the data table. `dao/internal/users.go` holds internal object implementations, should not be modified by users, and is not exposed. `dao/users.go` instantiates and exposes data access objects, where users can add custom methods.
