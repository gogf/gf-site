description: "Developing word management functions based on RESTful, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting words, implementing enumeration value management status, using a layered data model for data operations, supporting optimization techniques for composite indexes, pagination, and fuzzy queries."

In this chapter, we developed basic word-related functions based on `RESTful`:
- **Create Word**: Store words and related information into the database via `POST` requests;
- **Read Word**: Retrieve words and detailed information through `GET` requests, supporting pagination queries and `word` fuzzy queries;
- **Update Word**: Update existing word information via `PUT` requests;
- **Delete Word**: Delete specific words using `DELETE` requests.

Learned some advanced techniques:
- Managing status using enumeration values;
- Layered data model concept to limit direct data transfer;
- Composite indexes;
- Pagination queries;
- Fuzzy queries.
