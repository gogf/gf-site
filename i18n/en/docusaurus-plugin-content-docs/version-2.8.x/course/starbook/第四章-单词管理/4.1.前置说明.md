RESTful is a design principle for implementing simple and flexible web service architecture for resource management, using URIs to access resources and ensuring communication between systems through HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE."

In this chapter, you will learn the core skills of a programmerâ€”the famous CRUD operations, which stand for `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, and `Delete`. These operations form the basis of most application functionalities, and through them, we will accomplish the following tasks:
- Add new words;
- Edit words;
- Paginated list of words;
- Word details;
- Delete words.

## Introduction to `RESTful`
---
`RESTful` is a design principle for web services based on the `REST (Representational State Transfer)` architectural style. It is primarily used to create and access web resources and has the following characteristics:
- **Resources**: Every object in `RESTful` services is viewed as a resource that can be accessed through `URI` (Uniform Resource Identifier). For example, `/words` can represent word resources;
- **HTTP Methods**: `RESTful` services mainly use `HTTP Method` for performing operations:
  - `GET`: Read resources
  - `POST`: Create resources
  - `PUT`: Update resources
  - `PATCH`: Update partial resources
  - `DELETE`: Delete resources
- **Representational State Transfer**: Clients operate resources by requesting specific `URI`s, and servers return the representation of resources (usually in JSON or XML) in the response.
- **Uniform Interface**: Standardized interface design allows different systems to communicate with each other.

These principles make `RESTful` architecture simpler, more flexible, and scalable for `Web` services. Here is an example of the `CRUD` operations for words.

| Operation      | Method | URI           | Description               |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Create (`Create`) | `POST`   | `/words`      | Create a new word             |
| Read (`Read`)     | `GET`    | `/words`      | Get the list of all words     |
| Read (`Read`)     | `GET`    | `/words/{id}` | Get a single word based on `ID` |
| Update (`Update`) | `PUT`    | `/words/{id}` | Update the word with specified `ID` |
| Update (`Update`) | `PATCH`  | `/words/{id}` | Update partial fields of the word with specified `ID` |
| Delete (`Delete`) | `DELETE` | `/words/{id}` | Delete the word with specified `ID` |
