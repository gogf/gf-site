description: "This book uses the command line in some parts, with the dollar symbol as a prompt. It outputs information to the terminal, omitting unnecessary code to maintain cleanliness. Examples show how to perform basic output operations and code writing techniques using the GoFrame framework."

## Command Line
---
This book will use the command line in some places. I will use the `$` symbol as a prompt, and you do not need to type this symbol. For example, if I write `$ echo "Hello, GoFrame!"`, you only need to type `echo "Hello, GoFrame!"`.

```bash
$ echo "Hello, GoFrame!"
Hello, GoFrame!
```

`echo` is an output command, which outputs `Hello, GoFrame!` to the terminal.

## Code Omission
---
To maintain neatness, I will use `...` to omit code in unnecessary vertical code blocks.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

...

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello GoFrame")
}

...
```
