Don't worry if your versions differ from mine - the principles remain largely the same.

## GoFrame
---
We'll skip the basic installation of `Golang` and `GoFrame`. Here are the versions used in this tutorial:
- `go version go1.23.4 windows/amd64`
- `goframe v2.8.2`

## gRPC
---
`gRPC` is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework developed by Google, built on top of HTTP/2. It uses Protocol Buffers as its default serialization format.

Go provides gRPC functionality through the `gRPC-go` plugin. Install it using these commands:
```bash
$ go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
```

### gRPC Testing Tools
After developing gRPC interfaces, you'll need testing tools to verify their functionality. Popular options include `Postman`, `Apifox`, and `Apipost`. They're all similar - choose the one you prefer.

Throughout this book, we'll display test results in `json` format, like this:
```json
grpc 127.0.0.1:32001.account.v1.Account.UserRegister
{
    "username": "oldme",
    "password": "123456",
    "email": "tyyn1022@gmail.com"
}
{
    "id": 1
}
```

These represent the request address, request parameters, and response parameters, respectively.

## Protocol Buffers
---
Protocol Buffers is Google's data serialization format for structured data. It uses `.proto` files to define message structures, which are then compiled into language-specific code.

Download the appropriate version for your operating system from [Protocol Buffers Releases](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases). For MacOS users, you can install dependencies using `brew`:

```bash
$ brew install grpc protoc-gen-go protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
$ protoc --version
libprotoc 26.1
```

## etcd
---
etcd is a distributed key-value store commonly used for service discovery in distributed systems. There are several ways to install it. Here's a reference `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
    etcd:
        image: "bitnami/etcd:3.5"
        container_name: "etcd"
        restart: "always"
        ports:
            - 2379:2379
        environment:
            - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
            - ALLOW_NONE_AUTHENTICATION=yes
            - ETCD_ADVERTISE_CLIENT_URLS=http://etcd:2379
```

If installed successfully, visiting [http://IP:2379/version](http://IP:2379/version) in your browser should display:
```json
{"etcdserver": "3.5.17","etcdcluster": "3.5.0"}
```

For a more advanced setup, like installing an etcd cluster or learning etcd basics, check out [this article](https://oldme.net/article/32).

## Database
---
MySQL installation is straightforward, and you can use other databases if preferred.

Important: In a microservices architecture, each service should have its own database. We'll need to create two databases named `user` and `word`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE user;
CREATE DATABASE word;
