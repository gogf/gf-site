description: "A detailed guide on initializing a microservices project using the GoFrame CLI tool, including creating a Monorepo repository, configuring dependencies, and setting up the project structure."
---

## Repository Initialization
---
Use the following command to initialize a Monorepo repository named `proxima`:

```bash
$ gf init proxima -m
```

Update the minimum Go version in your environment to be compatible with GoFrame's requirements.

*go.mod*
```text
module proxima  
  
go 1.23.4
```

Upgrade GoFrame to the latest version:
```bash
$ cd proxima
gf up
```

Remove unnecessary example files:
```bash
$ rm -rf app/*
```

The resulting project structure will look like this:
```text
app
hack
    hack.mk
    hack-cli.mk
utility
go.mod
go.sum
```

In Monorepo mode, the root directory only manages project dependencies and doesn't contain a `main.go` file.

The `app` directory stores code for each microservice, such as `app/user/main.go` and `app/word/main.go`.

## Installing Microservice Components
---
Install the `grpcx` component to enable microservice development with GoFrame:
```bash
$ go get -u github.com/gogf/gf/contrib/rpc/grpcx/v2
```

## Installing Database Drivers
---
Like monolithic applications, you'll need to install the appropriate database driver. Here we'll demonstrate using MySQL:
```bash
$ go get -u github.com/gogf/gf/contrib/drivers/mysql/v2
```

## Installing etcd Components
---
Install the `etcd` component for service registration:
```bash
$ go get -u github.com/gogf/gf/contrib/registry/etcd/v2
