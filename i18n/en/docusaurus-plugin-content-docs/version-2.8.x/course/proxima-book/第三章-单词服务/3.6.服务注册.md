Add the configuration file:

*app/word/manifest/config/etcd.yaml*
```yaml
etcd:  
  address: "srv.com:2379"
```

Add the registration logic to the entry file:

*app/word/main.go*
```go
package main  
  
import (  
    _ "github.com/gogf/gf/contrib/drivers/mysql/v2"  
  
    "github.com/gogf/gf/contrib/registry/etcd/v2"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/contrib/rpc/grpcx/v2"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gctx"  
    
    "proxima/app/word/internal/cmd"
)  
  
func main() {  
    var ctx = gctx.New()  
    conf, err := g.Cfg("etcd").Get(ctx, "etcd.address")  
    if err != nil {  
       panic(err)  
    }  
  
    var address = conf.String()  
    grpcx.Resolver.Register(etcd.New(address))  
  
    cmd.Main.Run(ctx)  
}
```

Restart the project, enter the `etcd` container again, and execute the following command to verify:
```bash
$ etcdctl get "" --prefix --keys-only
/service/default/default/user/latest/{IP}:32001
/service/default/default/word/latest/{IP}:32002
```

As we can see, both of our microservices have been successfully registered. Next, we can run the gateway to start calling these services.
