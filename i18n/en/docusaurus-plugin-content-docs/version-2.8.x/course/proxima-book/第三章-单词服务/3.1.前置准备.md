After successfully implementing our first microservice, developing the second one will be more straightforward as we're now familiar with the process.

## Code Initialization
---
Execute the following command to create a service named `word` in the `app` directory.

```bash
$ gf init app/word -a
initializing...
initialization done! 
you can now run "cd app/word && gf run main.go" to start your journey, enjoy!
```

Following the same process as before, remove the following files to start with a clean environment:
```text
app/word/api/*
app/word/internal/controller/*
app/word/internal/cmd/cmd.go
```

Navigate to the microservice directory to begin development:
```bash
$ cd app/word
```

## Generating Data Models
---
### Creating Database Tables
Execute the following SQL statement in the `word` database to create the table for storing word data:
```sql
CREATE TABLE words (
    id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    uid INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    word VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL,
    definition TEXT,
    example_sentence TEXT,
    chinese_translation VARCHAR ( 255 ),
    pronunciation VARCHAR ( 255 ),
    created_at DATETIME,
    updated_at DATETIME
);
```

### Generating DAO Models
*app/user/hack/config.yaml*
```yaml
gfcli:  
  gen:  
    dao:  
      - link: "mysql:root:12345678@tcp(srv.com:3306)/word"  
        descriptionTag: true
```

```bash
$ gf gen dao
generated: D:\project\proxima\app\word\internal\dao\words.go
generated: D:\project\proxima\app\word\internal\dao\internal\words.go
generated: D:\project\proxima\app\word\internal\model\do\words.go
generated: D:\project\proxima\app\word\internal\model\entity\words.go
done!
```

### Generating Protocol Buffer Entity Models
*app/user/hack/config.yaml*
```bash
gfcli:
  gen:  
    dao:  
      - link: "mysql:root:12345678@tcp(srv.com:3306)/word"  
        descriptionTag: true  
  
    pbentity:  
      - link: "mysql:root:12345678@tcp(srv.com:3306)/word"
```

```bash
$ gf gen pbentity
generated: D:\project\proxima\app\word\manifest\protobuf\pbentity\words.proto
done!
