Most aspects of microservice development are similar to monolithic services, and in many cases, even simpler. This chapter covers some basic preparations that should be familiar to everyone.

## Code Initialization
---
GoFrame provides a command for initializing microservice repositories. Execute the following command to create a service named `user` in the `app` directory.

```bash
$ gf init app/user -a
initializing...
initialization done! 
you can now run "cd app/user && gf run main.go" to start your journey, enjoy!
```

After successful initialization, a microservice will be created in the `app` directory. It's similar to a monolithic service, except that it lacks the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files.

Delete the following files to start with a clean environment:
```text
app/user/api/*
app/user/internal/controller/*
app/user/internal/cmd/cmd.go
```

After completing these steps, enter the microservice repository to begin development.
```bash
$ cd app/user
```

## Database Setup
---
### Creating Tables
In the `user` database, execute the following SQL statement to create a table for storing user data:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  password CHAR(32) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100),
  created_at DATETIME,
  updated_at DATETIME
);
```

### Generating DAO Models
*app/user/hack/config.yaml*
```yaml
gfcli:  
  gen:  
    dao:  
      - link: "mysql:root:12345678@tcp(srv.com:3306)/user"  
        descriptionTag: true
```

```bash
$ gf gen dao
generated: D:\project\proxima\app\user\internal\dao\users.go
generated: D:\project\proxima\app\user\internal\dao\internal\users.go
generated: D:\project\proxima\app\user\internal\model\do\users.go
generated: D:\project\proxima\app\user\internal\model\entity\users.go
done!
```

> Note: Execute the `gf gen dao` command in the microservice repository (i.e., the `app/user` directory). Be careful not to get this wrong. Similar rules apply to other related operations.

### Generating Protocol Buffer Entity Models
*app/user/hack/config.yaml*
```yaml
gfcli:
  gen:  
    dao:  
      - link: "mysql:root:12345678@tcp(srv.com:3306)/user"  
        descriptionTag: true  
  
    pbentity:  
      - link: "mysql:root:12345678@tcp(srv.com:3306)/user"
```

```bash
$ gf gen pbentity
generated: D:\project\proxima\app\user\manifest\protobuf\pbentity\users.proto
done!
```

### Differences Between `gen dao` and `gen pbentity`

- `gen dao` generates Go files primarily used within the microservice, such as for ORM operations
- `gen pbentity` generates Protocol Buffer files mainly used for gRPC communication between microservices
