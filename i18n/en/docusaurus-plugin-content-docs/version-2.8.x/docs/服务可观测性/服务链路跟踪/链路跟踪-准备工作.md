description: "Implement tracing with Jaeger in the GoFrame framework. We will demonstrate how to introduce distributed tracing in a system through a combination of Jaeger and OpenTelemetry, including a quick deployment method for Jaeger and the location of example code in the GoFrame framework, as well as encapsulated registration modules."
---

After gaining a preliminary understanding of the concept of `OpenTelemetry`, we will use `Jaeger` as an example to demonstrate how to implement tracing in a program.

## Jaeger

[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) \\ˈyā-gər\ is Uber's open-source distributed tracing system and one of the systems that support `OpenTelemetry`. It is also a `CNCF` project. In this article, we will use `Jaeger` to demonstrate how to introduce distributed tracing into a system. Below is the architecture diagram for `Opentracing+Jaeger`, which also applies to using `OpenTelemetry`.

## Preparation

`Jaeger` offers an `all-in-one` image, which allows us to quickly start testing:

```bash
docker run --rm --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411 \
  -p 6831:6831/udp \
  -p 6832:6832/udp \
  -p 5778:5778 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  -p 14250:14250 \
  -p 14268:14268 \
  -p 14269:14269 \
  -p 9411:9411 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.55
```

If pulling the `docker` image is too slow, you can try modifying the image address of the `docker` pull site, such as: [http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/help/dockerhub.html?highlight=docker](http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/help/dockerhub.html?highlight=docker)

After the image starts, you can open the `Jaeger UI` via [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686/).

## Sample Code Address

Our sample code is in the `gf` main repository, located at: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/example/trace](https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/example/trace)

## Encapsulated Jaeger Registration (to be removed in version 2.6.0)

For developers' convenience, we have encapsulated the initialization logic for `jaeger` through a community module, code address: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/trace/jaeger](https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/trace/jaeger)

## OTLP HTTP Encapsulation

For developers' convenience, we have encapsulated the initialization logic for `otelhttp` through a community module, code address: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/trace/otlphttp](https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/trace/otlphttp)

## OTLP GRPC Encapsulation

For developers' convenience, we have encapsulated the initialization logic for `otelgrpc` through a community module, code address: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/trace/otlpgrpc](https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/trace/otlpgrpc)
