description: "Using GoFrame for tracing in a single process by creating a Root Span to trace method call chains and viewing results in Jaeger UI. It introduces how to create Spans between methods to record the process of method calls and demonstrates in detail with example code how to implement the transmission of trace information and performance monitoring in the GoFrame framework, helping users quickly locate system anomalies and identify performance bottlenecks."

## Single Process Example

Single process tracing refers to the call chain relationship between methods within the process. This scenario does not involve distributed tracing, making it relatively simple. Let's use this example as our introductory case. Example code address: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/example/trace/inprocess](https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/example/trace/inprocess)

## Root Span

`root span` is the first `span` object in the trace. In the single process scenario here, it often needs to be created manually. Subsequently, `spans` created within methods will act as its child `spans`.
:::tip
In inter-service communication scenarios of distributed architectures, it is often unnecessary for developers to manually create a `root span`, as it is automatically created by interceptors of client/server requests.
:::
Create a `tracer` and generate a `root span`:

```go
func main() {
    const (
        serviceName = "otlp-http-client"
        endpoint    = "tracing-analysis-dc-hz.aliyuncs.com"
        path        = "adapt_******_******/api/otlp/traces"
    )

    var ctx = gctx.New()
    shutdown, err := otlphttp.Init(serviceName, endpoint, path)
    if err != nil {
        g.Log().Fatal(ctx, err)
    }
    defer shutdown()

    ctx, span := gtrace.NewSpan(ctx, "main")
    defer span.End()

    // Trace 1.
    user1 := GetUser(ctx, 1)
    g.Dump(user1)

    // Trace 2.
    user100 := GetUser(ctx, 100)
    g.Dump(user100)
}
```

The above code creates a `root span` and passes this `span` through `context` to the `GetUser` method, so that the trace chain can continue within the `GetUser` method.

## Span Creation Between Methods

```go
// GetUser retrieves and returns hard coded user data for demonstration.
func GetUser(ctx context.Context, id int) g.Map {
    ctx, span := gtrace.NewSpan(ctx, "GetUser")
    defer span.End()
    m := g.Map{}
    gutil.MapMerge(
        m,
        GetInfo(ctx, id),
        GetDetail(ctx, id),
        GetScores(ctx, id),
    )
    return m
}

// GetInfo retrieves and returns hard coded user info for demonstration.
func GetInfo(ctx context.Context, id int) g.Map {
    ctx, span := gtrace.NewSpan(ctx, "GetInfo")
    defer span.End()
    if id == 100 {
        return g.Map{
            "id":     100,
            "name":   "john",
            "gender": 1,
        }
    }
    return nil
}

// GetDetail retrieves and returns hard coded user detail for demonstration.
func GetDetail(ctx context.Context, id int) g.Map {
    ctx, span := gtrace.NewSpan(ctx, "GetDetail")
    defer span.End()
    if id == 100 {
        return g.Map{
            "site":  "https://goframe.org",
            "email": "john@goframe.org",
        }
    }
    return nil
}

// GetScores retrieves and returns hard coded user scores for demonstration.
func GetScores(ctx context.Context, id int) g.Map {
    ctx, span := gtrace.NewSpan(ctx, "GetScores")
    defer span.End()
    if id == 100 {
        return g.Map{
            "math":    100,
            "english": 60,
            "chinese": 50,
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

This example code shows multi-level method trace information transmission, meaning that the `ctx` context variable is passed as the first parameter of the method. Within the method, we use fixed syntax to create/start a `Span`:

```go
ctx, span := gtrace.NewSpan(ctx, "xxx")
defer span.End()
```

By calling `span.End` using `defer`, we end a `Span`, which records the lifecycle (start and end) information of the `Span`. This information will be displayed in the tracing system. For the second parameter `spanName` of the `gtrace.NewSpan` method, we directly give the method name so that it is more recognizable in the trace display.

## Result Viewing

After executing the above program, the terminal outputs:

Open `Jaeger UI`: [http://localhost:16686/search](http://localhost:16686/search), and you can see the trace results: ![](/markdown/bd0a6f9c87f239e6730243a09de02d6d.jpg)

Clicking on the details allows you to view specific information, including the invocation order and relationship of `spans`, the execution timeline, and recorded Attributes and Events information, which significantly helps us locate system anomalies and identify performance bottlenecks.

The `tracing-inprocess` is the name of our `tracer`, which is usually the service name. Since we only have one process and one `tracer`, there is only one service name displayed here. The `main` is the name of the `root span` we created, and other `spans` were created based on this `root span`. Since we called the `GetUser` method twice in the program, it shows two calls to the `GetUser` method. Each `GetUser` call internally invokes the three methods `GetInfo`, `GetDetail`, and `GetScores`, and the hierarchical relationship of method calls is displayed very clearly, along with the duration of each method call.

The `Tags` and `Process` information recorded in each `span` corresponds to the `Attributes` and `Events` information in `OpenTelemetry`, which we will introduce in more detail in subsequent chapters.
