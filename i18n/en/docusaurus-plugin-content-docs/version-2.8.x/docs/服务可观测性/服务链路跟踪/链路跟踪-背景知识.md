## OpenTelemetry

The concept of Distributed Tracing was first proposed by `Google`. The technology has matured over time, and there are now some protocol standards available for reference. Currently, two open-source frameworks are quite influential in this area: `Netflix's` `OpenTracing` and `Google's` `OpenCensus`. Both frameworks have a sizable developer community. To establish a unified technical standard, the two frameworks merged to form the `OpenTelemetry` project, abbreviated as `otel`. For more details, you can refer to:

1. [Introduction to OpenTracing](https://johng.cn/observability/opentracing-introduction)
2. [Introduction to OpenTelemetry](https://johng.cn/observability/opentelemetry-introduction)

Thus, our tracing technology solution is implemented based on the `OpenTelemetry` standard, with some open-source projects implementing the protocol standard in `Golang`:

2. [https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib)

Other third-party frameworks and systems (such as `Jaeger/Prometheus/Grafana`) also adhere to standardized protocols to integrate with `OpenTelemetry`, significantly reducing development and maintenance costs.

## Key Concepts

Let's first look at the architecture diagram of `OpenTelemetry`. 
We won't introduce it in full, only the commonly used concepts. For an introduction to the internal technical architecture of `OpenTelemetry`, 
you can refer to [OpenTelemetry Architecture](https://johng.cn/observability/opentelemetry-architecture), 
and for semantic conventions, please refer to: [https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md)

### TracerProvider

Mainly responsible for creating `Tracer`, usually requiring a concrete implementation from a third-party distributed tracing management platform. By default, it is an empty `TracerProvider (NoopTracerProvider)`. While it can create `Tracer`, it doesn’t actually execute specific data flow transmission logic internally.

### Tracer

`Tracer` represents a complete tracing, consisting of one or more `span`. The example below illustrates a `tracer` consisting of `8` spans:

```
        [Span A]  ←←←(the root span)
            |
     +------+------+
     |             |
 [Span B]      [Span C] ←←←(Span C is a `ChildOf` Span A)
     |             |
 [Span D]      +---+-------+
               |           |
           [Span E]    [Span F] >>> [Span G] >>> [Span H]
                                       ↑
                                       ↑
                                       ↑
                         (Span G `FollowsFrom` Span F)
```

The timeline representation makes it easier to understand:

```
––|–––––––|–––––––|–––––––|–––––––|–––––––|–––––––|–––––––|–> time

 [Span A···················································]
   [Span B··············································]
      [Span D··········································]
    [Span C········································]
         [Span E·······]        [Span F··] [Span G··] [Span H··]
```

We usually create a `Tracer` in the following way:

```
gtrace.NewTracer(tracerName)
```

### Span

A `Span` is a fundamental component of a tracing. It represents a single work unit, such as a function call or an `HTTP` request. A `span` records the following essential elements:

- Service name (`operation name`)
- Service start and end times
- `K/V` form `Tags`
- `K/V` form `Logs`
- `SpanContext`

`Span` is the most frequently used object among them, thus creating a `Span` is very straightforward, for example:

```
gtrace.NewSpan(ctx, spanName, opts...)
```

### Attributes

`Attributes` are stored as `K/V` key-value pairs for user-defined tags, mainly used for query filtering of tracing results. For example: `http.method="GET",http.status_code=200`. The `key` must be a string, and the `value` must be a string, boolean, or numeric type. `Attributes` in a `span` are only visible to itself and are not passed to subsequent spans through `SpanContext`. The way to set `Attributes` is as follows:

```
span.SetAttributes(
    label.String("http.remote", conn.RemoteAddr().String()),
    label.String("http.local", conn.LocalAddr().String()),
)
```

### Events

`Events` are similar to `Attributes` and are also in the form of `K/V` key-value pairs. Unlike `Attributes`, `Events` also record the time when they are written, so `Events` are mainly used to record the time certain events occur. The `key` for `Events` must also be a string, but there are no restrictions on the type of `value`. For example:

```
span.AddEvent("http.request", trace.WithAttributes(
    label.Any("http.request.header", headers),
    label.Any("http.request.baggage", gtrace.GetBaggageMap(ctx)),
    label.String("http.request.body", bodyContent),
))
```

### SpanContext

`SpanContext` carries some data used for **cross-service (cross-process) communication**, mainly including:

- Information sufficient to identify this span within the system, e.g., `span_id, trace_id`.
- `Baggage` - maintains user-defined `K/V` formatted data for cross-service (cross-process) tracing in the entire tracing link. `Baggage` is similar to `Attributes`, also in `K/V` key-value pair format. The differences are:

- Both `key` and `value` can only be in string format.
- `Baggage` is visible not only to the current span but is also passed to all subsequent child spans through `SpanContext`. Be cautious using `Baggage` because transmitting these `K,V` in all spans incurs non-trivial network and CPU overhead.

### Propagator

The `Propagator` is used for encoding/decoding data end-to-end, such as data transmission from the `Client` to the `Server`. `TraceId`, `SpanId`, and `Baggage` also need to be managed for data transmission through the propagator. Business-end developers are usually not aware of the `Propagator`, only middleware/interceptor developers need to understand its role. The standard protocol implementation library of `OpenTelemetry` provides a commonly used `TextMapPropagator` for common text data end-to-end transmission. Furthermore, to ensure compatibility of the data transmitted in the `TextMapPropagator`, special characters should not be included. For details, please refer to: [https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/context/api-propagators.md](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/context/api-propagators.md)

The `GoFrame` framework uses the following propagator objects through the `gtrace` module and sets them globally in `OpenTelemetry`:

```go
// defaultTextMapPropagator is the default propagator for context propagation between peers.
defaultTextMapPropagator = propagation.NewCompositeTextMapPropagator(
    propagation.TraceContext{},
    propagation.Baggage{},
)
```

## Supported Components
:::tip
The core components of `GoFrame` have fully supported the `OpenTelemetry` standard and **automatically enable** the tracing feature, with no need for developers to explicitly call or use it. Without injecting an external `TracerProvider`, the framework will use the default `TracerProvider`, which will only automatically create a `TraceID` and `SpanID` to facilitate tracing the request log and will not execute complex logic.
:::
Including but not limited to the following core components:

| Components with Auto Tracing Support | Component Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HTTP Client` | `gclient` | The `HTTP` client automatically enables the tracing feature. For specific usage examples, please refer to the subsequent example chapter. |
| `Http Server` | `ghttp` | The `HTTP` server automatically enables the tracing feature. For specific usage examples, please refer to the subsequent example chapter. |
| `gRPC Client` | `contrib/rpc/grpcx` | The `gRPC` client automatically enables the tracing feature. For specific usage examples, please refer to the subsequent example chapter. |
| `gRPC Server` | `contrib/rpc/grpcx` | The `gRPC` server automatically enables the tracing feature. For specific usage examples, please refer to the subsequent example chapter. |
| `Logging` | `glog` | The log content needs to inject the current request's `TraceId` to quickly locate issues through logs. This feature is implemented by the `glog` component. Developers need to call the `Ctx` chain operation method to pass the `context.Context` context variable to the current logging operation chain when outputting logs. Failing to pass the `context.Context` will result in losing the `TraceId` in the log content. |
| `ORM` | `gdb` | The execution of the database is an essential part of the link. The `Orm` component needs to deliver its execution information into the tracing as part of the execution trace. |
| `NoSQL Redis` | `gredis` | The execution of `Redis` is also an essential part of the tracing. `Redis` needs to deliver its execution information into the tracing as part of the execution trace. |
| `Utils` | `gtrace` | Managing the `Tracing` feature requires some encapsulation, mainly considering extensibility and usability. This encapsulation is implemented by the `gtrace` module. The documentation can be found at: [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/gtrace](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/gtrace) |
