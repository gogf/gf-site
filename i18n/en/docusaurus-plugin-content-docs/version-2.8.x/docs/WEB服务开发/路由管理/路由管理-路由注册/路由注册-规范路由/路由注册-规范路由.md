description: "Standardized router registration method of GoFrame framework, suitable for complex projects and team collaboration. Supported from version v2.0, covering features like structured API design, parameter style definition, automatic generation and synchronized maintenance of API documents, etc."

## Introduction

Starting from version `v2.0`, the `Server` component of the framework provides an additional standardized router registration method, which is more suitable for scenarios that require team standardization and projects with higher business complexity. The specified router implements the following features:

- Standardization of `API` design according to structured programming
- Specification of `API` API method parameter style definitions
- Simplified router registration and maintenance
- Unified API return data format design
- Ensures synchronized maintenance of code and API documentation
- Automatic reception and validation of `API` parameter objects
- Automatic generation of API documentation based on the standard `OpenAPIv3` protocol
- Automatic generation of `SwaggerUI` pages
:::tip
Please note that **specified router** along with the original **function, object, group** routing methods are all registration methods supported by the framework's `HTTP Server` component. They are designed to solve scenarios of standardized and automated API management and are more suitable for multi-person team collaboration. Other routing methods, especially the function and object registration methods of the framework's `v1` version, are also supported in the new version! Choose reasonably based on personal usage habits.
