description: "How to support multiple HTTP Method submissions for the same API under the strict routing of the GoFrame framework. When designing RESTful APIs, each API should correspond to a specific HTTP Method, such as creating a user or retrieving a user list, etc. If multiple HTTP Methods need to be supported for an API, it can be set through Meta tags. Additionally, learn how to use type aliasing to return array forms for the Data field in the Response structure."

## How to support multiple `HTTP Method` submissions for the same API under strict routing

First, an API should only perform one function. `HTTP Method` is meaningful (for example, in `RESTful` API design). An API supporting multiple `HTTP Method` types is usually a sign of poor API design, and it's recommended to review the API design.

Generally, there is no scenario where an `API` needs to be associated with multiple `HTTP Methods`. For example, for user APIs, a `CRUD` API in RESTful implementation should have `4-5` API definitions, each implementing different business logic. Therefore, there might be the following API definitions for a `RESTful` API:

```
API Name    Method    Path
Create User       PUT       /user
User List         GET       /user
User Details      GET       /user/{uid}
Modify User       POST      /user/{uid}
Delete User       DELETE    /user/{uid}
```

If indeed there is a scenario where an API needs to support multiple `HTTP Methods`, it can be done by using a comma `,` to separate each `HTTP Method` in the `method` attribute of the `Meta` tag, for example:

```go
type SaveReq struct {
    g.Meta `path:"/user/{uid}" method:"put,post" summary:"Save User" tags:"User Management"`
    Uid    int64  `dc:"User ID"`
    Name   string `dc:"Username"`
    // ...
}
```

## How to make the `Data` field return only as an array without a named key-value pair using the default provided `Response` structure

This can be achieved by using type aliasing.
