## Introduction

`WebServer` requires the support of methods/objects to provide services. The `ghttp` package supports multiple route registration modes, providing developers with very powerful and flexible API functionality.

Route registration is the most core part of the entire `WebServer` and one of the most carefully designed modules in the `goframe` framework.

API documentation: [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/ghttp](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/ghttp)

## Considerations

Starting from version `v2` of the framework, the feature of **standardized routing** has been added, making it more suitable for engineering scenarios in business projects. It is recommended to use standardized routing in complex business projects: [Standard Router](路由注册-规范路由/路由注册-规范路由.md)
