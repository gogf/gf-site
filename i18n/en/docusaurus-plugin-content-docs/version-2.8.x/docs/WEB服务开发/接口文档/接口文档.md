## Introduction

The `GoFrame` framework supports fully automated API documentation generation, ensuring that the code and API documentation are maintained synchronously. The automatically generated API documentation adopts the standard `OpenAPIv3` protocol. Before introducing the `OpenAPIv3` protocol, it is recommended that you first read and understand the framework's standardized routing features: [Standard Router](../路由管理/路由管理-路由注册/路由注册-规范路由/路由注册-规范路由.md).
