description: "Utilizing the pprof tool for performance analysis in a Web Server built with the GoFrame framework. The GoFrame framework integrates pprof, allowing for easy activation of performance analysis through the EnablePProf method. It also explores how to set up an independent PProf Server to effectively monitor key metrics such as memory usage, goroutine behavior, and CPU performance. The document provides concrete command line examples and analysis."

The `GoFrame` framework's `Web Server` offers a very robust and easy-to-use service performance analysis feature. It is perfectly integrated with the `pprof` performance analysis tool, which can be activated anytime via the `EnablePProf` method. You can also customize the route address for the performance analysis tool; if not provided, the default URI is `/debug/pprof`.

## `PProf` Activation
:::warning
The activation of the `PProf` feature will have some impact on program performance. The specific degree of influence should be compared before and after the `PProf` is enabled based on the current business scenario.
:::
### `EnablePProf`

Let's look at a simple example:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/ghttp"
    "runtime"
)

func main() {
    runtime.SetMutexProfileFraction(1) // (optional) Enable lock call tracing
    runtime.SetBlockProfileRate(1)     // (optional) Enable blocking operation tracing

    s := g.Server()
    s.EnablePProf()
    s.BindHandler("/", func(r *ghttp.Request) {
        r.Response.Writeln("Hello World!")
    })
    s.SetPort(8199)
    s.Run()
}
```

This example uses `s.EnablePProf()` to enable performance analysis. By default, the following routes are registered:

```html
/debug/pprof/*action
/debug/pprof/cmdline
/debug/pprof/profile
/debug/pprof/symbol
/debug/pprof/trace
```

Among these, `/debug/pprof/*action` is used for page access, and the others are prepared for the `go tool pprof` command.

### `StartPProfServer`

You can also use the `StartPProfServer` method to quickly start an independent `PProf Server`, often used in long-running processes without an `HTTP Server` (such as cron jobs or `GRPC` services), for program performance analysis. The method is defined as:

```go
func StartPProfServer(port int, pattern ...string)
```

In general, it is used in an asynchronous `goroutine` to run the `PProf Server`, typically like this:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/ghttp"
)

func main() {
    go ghttp.StartPProfServer(8199)
    // Other services startup and running
    // ...
}
```

The above example can be improved to:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/ghttp"
)

func main() {
    go ghttp.StartPProfServer(8299)

    s := g.Server()
    s.EnablePProf()
    s.BindHandler("/", func(r *ghttp.Request) {
        r.Response.Writeln("Hello World!")
    })
    s.SetPort(8199)
    s.Run()
}
```

## `PProf` Metrics

- `heap`: Reports memory allocation samples for monitoring current and historical memory usage and investigating memory leaks.
- `threadcreate`: Reports sections of the program that caused the creation of a new OS thread.
- `goroutine`: Reports stack traces of all current `goroutines`.
- `block`: Shows where `goroutines` block waiting on synchronization primitives (including timer channels). Not enabled by default; needs `runtime.SetBlockProfileRate` to enable.
- `mutex`: Reports lock contention. Not enabled by default; needs `runtime.SetMutexProfileFraction` to enable.

## `PProf` Pages

For simple performance analysis, directly accessing the `/debug/pprof` address is sufficient, and the content is as follows:

1. `pprof` page

2. Heap Usage

3. Details of `goroutines` in the current process

## Performance Data Collection and AnalysisðŸ”¥
:::tip
The screenshots in the examples below are sourced from sample projects and are for reference only.
:::
For detailed performance analysis, the `go tool pprof` command-line tool is indispensable. After enabling performance analysis support, you can perform performance data collection and analysis with the following command:

```bash
go tool pprof -http :8080 "http://127.0.0.1:8199/debug/pprof/profile"
```

You can also export the pprof file and then open it with the go tool pprof command:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8199/debug/pprof/profile > pprof.profile
go tool pprof -http :8080 pprof.profile
```

After approximately `30` seconds of API data collection by the `pprof` tool (during which time the `WebServer` should have incoming traffic), a performance analysis report is generated. You can then view the report results using `top10`/`web` and other `pprof` commands. For more commands, use `go tool pprof`. For detailed usage of `pprof`, please refer to Golang's official documentation: [blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs)

### CPU Performance Analysis

The command line performance analysis result in this example is as follows:

```bash
$ go tool pprof -http :8080 "http://127.0.0.1:8199/debug/pprof/profile"
Serving web UI on http://localhost:8080
```
:::tip
To display `pprof` graphically, the `Graphviz` graphical tool needs to be installed. For my current system, `Ubuntu`, install by executing `sudo apt-get install graphviz` (for `MacOS`, use `brew install Graphviz`).
:::
After running, it will open the following graphical API using the default browser, displaying the CPU cost path captured during this period:

You can also view the flame graph, which might be more illustrative:

### Memory Usage Analysis

Similar to `CPU` performance analysis, memory usage analysis also utilizes the `go tool pprof` command:

```bash
$ go tool pprof -http :8080 "http://127.0.0.1:8199/debug/pprof/heap"
Serving web UI on http://localhost:8080
```

The graphical display is similar to this:

![](/markdown/3740981520744e6a3831ba5f2c811e23.png)

Again, you can view the flame graph, which might be more illustrative:

![](/markdown/8f5ef1007b9eaddab88adadfff9f6101.png)

### Goroutine Usage Analysis

Similar to the above analysis, `goroutine` usage analysis also uses the `go tool pprof` command:

```bash
$ go tool pprof -http :8080 "http://127.0.0.1:8199/debug/pprof/goroutine"
Serving web UI on http://localhost:8080
```

The graphical display is similar to this, and usually, when looking at `goroutines`, this graph is sufficient, although there is also a flame graph available.
