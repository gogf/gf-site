## Introduction

Due to its modular design, the `GoFrame` framework can be used as a utility library or for complete business project development.

Considering that most scenarios for using the framework are for developing business projects (microservices projects), the framework also provides some design and practices for engineering development for direct out-of-the-box use.

## Precautions

Engineering development design is a complex "discipline." Different teams have different design styles, and in some scenarios, it is often influenced by the preferences of the team `leader`.

The engineering development design provided on the framework's official website is based on the author's experience in writing this section and through project pitfalls encountered in `Go` practice. It can help solve common engineering development problems, but we do not believe it can meet the preferences of all development teams.

Reviewing all the design sections here and understanding the background and ideas of each piece of design itself is more valuable than directly using framework components and tools.
