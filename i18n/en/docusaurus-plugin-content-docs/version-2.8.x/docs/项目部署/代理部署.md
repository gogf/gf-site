description: "Deploy GoFrame applications using Nginx as a reverse proxy front-end access layer. By configuring static file extensions or directories, you can effectively separate static and dynamic requests to improve performance. Configuration examples show how to forward requests to a Golang application for a professional WebServer deployment solution."
---

Proxy deployment involves placing a layer of third-party `WebServer` server in front to handle all requests, selectively forwarding some requests (often dynamically processed requests) to the backend `Golang` applications for execution. The backend-deployed `Golang` applications can be configured with multiple instances. This approach is commonly used in complex `WebServer` configurations, such as scenarios requiring static file separation, multiple domain and certificate configurations, custom load balancing layers, and more.

Although `Golang` implemented `WebServer` can handle static files, it is relatively simple and less performant compared to professional `WebServer` like `nginx`/ `apache`. Therefore, using `Golang WebServer` as the front-end service to directly handle static file requests is not recommended.

## `Nginx`

We recommend using `Nginx` as a reverse proxy front-end access layer, which has two configuration methods for separating static and dynamic requests.

### Static File Suffix

This approach differentiates by file name suffix, delegating specified static files to `nginx` for processing, while other requests are forwarded to the `golang` application. The configuration example is as follows:

```conf
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  goframe.org;

    access_log   /var/log/gf-app-access.log;
    error_log    /var/log/gf-app-error.log;

    location ~ .*\.(gif|jpg|jpeg|png|js|css|eot|ttf|woff|svg|otf)$ {
        access_log off;
        expires    1d;
        root       /var/www/gf-app/public;
        try_files  $uri @backend;
    }

    location / {
        try_files $uri @backend;
    }

    location @backend {
        proxy_pass                 http://127.0.0.1:8199;
        proxy_redirect             off;
        proxy_set_header           Host             $host;
        proxy_set_header           X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header           X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

Here, `8199` is the local `golang` application `WebServer` listening port.

For example, under this configuration, you can access the specified static file via `http://goframe.org/my.png`.

### Static File Directory

This method distinguishes by file directory, delegating access requests for specified directories to `nginx`, while other requests are forwarded to the `golang` application. The configuration example is as follows:

```conf
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  goframe.org;

    access_log   /var/log/gf-app-access.log;
    error_log    /var/log/gf-app-error.log;

    location ^~ /public {
        access_log off;
        expires    1d;
        root       /var/www/gf-app;
        try_files  $uri @backend;
    }

    location / {
        try_files $uri @backend;
    }

    location @backend {
        proxy_pass                 http://127.0.0.1:8199;
        proxy_redirect             off;
        proxy_set_header           Host             $host;
        proxy_set_header           X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header           X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

Here, `8199` is the local `golang` application `WebServer` listening port.

For example, under this configuration, you can access static files via `http://goframe.org/public/my.png`.
