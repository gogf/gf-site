description: "Process management under the GoFrame framework, including how to execute Shell commands, determine the relationship between the main process and the subprocess, and the basic usage of multi-process management. Demonstrates the use of the gproc package through example code, such as creating subprocesses, managing existing processes, and implementing monitoring and control of specific processes in a Linux environment."

## Execute Shell Commands

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gctx"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gproc"
)

func main() {
    r, err := gproc.ShellExec(gctx.New(), `sleep 3; echo "hello gf!";`)
    fmt.Println("result:", r)
    fmt.Println(err)
}
```

After execution, you can see that the program waits for 3 seconds, and the output result is:

```
result: hello gf!

<nil>
```

## Main Process and Subprocess

Processes created by the `gproc.Manager` object are marked as subprocesses by default. In a subprocess program, you can use the `gproc.IsChild()` method to determine if it is a subprocess.

```go
package main

import (
    "os"
    "time"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gctx"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gproc"
)

func main() {
    var ctx = gctx.New()
    if gproc.IsChild() {
        g.Log().Printf(ctx, "%d: Hi, I am child, waiting 3 seconds to die", gproc.Pid())
        time.Sleep(time.Second)
        g.Log().Printf(ctx, "%d: 1", gproc.Pid())
        time.Sleep(time.Second)
        g.Log().Printf(ctx, "%d: 2", gproc.Pid())
        time.Sleep(time.Second)
        g.Log().Printf(ctx, "%d: 3", gproc.Pid())
    } else {
        m := gproc.NewManager()
        p := m.NewProcess(os.Args[0], os.Args, os.Environ())
        p.Start(ctx)
        p.Wait()
        g.Log().Printf(ctx, "%d: child died", gproc.Pid())
    }
}
```

After execution, the terminal prints the following result:

```html
2018-05-18 14:35:41.360 28285: Hi, I am child, waiting 3 seconds to die
2018-05-18 14:35:42.361 28285: 1
2018-05-18 14:35:43.361 28285: 2
2018-05-18 14:35:44.361 28285: 3
2018-05-18 14:35:44.362 28278: child died
```

## Multi-process Management

In addition to creating subprocesses and managing them, `gproc` can also manage other processes not created by itself. `gproc` can manage multiple processes simultaneously. Here we demonstrate the management function with a single process as an example.

1. We use the `gedit` software (a commonly used text editor on Linux) to open a file at random. In the process, we see that the process ID of this gedit is `28536`.

```shell
    $ ps aux | grep gedit
    john  28536  3.6  0.6 946208 56412 ?  Sl  14:39  0:00 gedit /home/john/Documents/text
```

2. Our program is as follows:

```go
package main

import (
       "fmt"

       "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gproc"
)

func main() {
       pid := 28536
       m := gproc.NewManager()
       m.AddProcess(pid)
       m.KillAll()
       m.WaitAll()
       fmt.Printf("%d was killed\n", pid)
}
```

After execution, `gedit` is closed, and the terminal output is:

```
28536 was killed
```
