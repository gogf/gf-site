## `SetTimeZone` Setting Global Time Zone

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gtime"
)

func main() {
    // Set the global time zone for the process
    err := gtime.SetTimeZone("Asia/Tokyo")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Use gtime to get the current time
    fmt.Println(gtime.Now().String())

    // Use standard library to get the current time
    fmt.Println(time.Now().String())
}
```

After execution, the output result is:

2023-01-06 15:27:38
2023-01-06 15:27:38.753909 +0900 JST m=+0.002758145
```

## Time Zone Settings Precautions

### `SetTimeZone` Method Multiple Calls Error

The `SetTimeZone` method allows setting the global time zone only once. If called multiple times with different time zones, subsequent calls will fail and return an `error`.

### Initialization Issue with the `time` Package in Business Projects

The global setting of the program's time zone must be called before importing the standard library's `time` package, as it initializes upon import, preventing further global time zone changes. Time zone conversions on specific time objects can only be done using the `ToLocation` method (or the standard library's `In` method). An example of converting using `ToLocation`:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gtime"
)

func main() {
    // Set the global time zone for the process
    err := gtime.SetTimeZone("Asia/Tokyo")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Use gtime to get the current time
    fmt.Println(gtime.Now())

    // Use standard library to get the current time
    fmt.Println(time.Now())

    // Perform time zone conversion on a specific time object
    local, err := time.LoadLocation("Asia/Shanghai")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(gtime.Now().ToLocation(local))
}
```

After execution, the terminal outputs:

```html
2023-01-06 15:37:38
2023-01-06 15:37:38.753909 +0900 JST m=+0.002758145
2023-01-06 14:37:38
```

In business projects, there are often many business packages `import` before the `main` package, which can cause initialization issues with the `time` package. Therefore, if you need to set the time zone globally, it is recommended to call the `SetTimeZone` method through an independent package and execute `import` at the very beginning of the `main` package to avoid initialization issues with the `time` package.
