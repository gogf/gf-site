description: "The time management module in the GoFrame framework focuses on the custom time format feature of the gtime.Time object. By comparing it to the Format method of the standard library time.Time, gtime provides the Layout method to achieve standard format date conversion, listing the details of various time format syntax supported by the gtime module, helping developers efficiently manage and convert date and time."

:::warning
Note: The `gtime.Time` object uses the `Format` method to achieve custom formatted date and time conversion, which conflicts with the `Format` method of the standard library `time.Time`. In the `gtime.Time` object, the `Layout` method is used to implement the `Format` format of the standard library `time.Time`, for example: `t.Layout('2006-01-02 15:04:05')`.
