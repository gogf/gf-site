description: "Configuration of the development environment under the GoFrame framework, mainly including the environment variable settings of Go language and tool configuration in Goland. It provides detailed instructions on how to set environment variables like GOROOT, GOPATH, and PATH, along with specific configuration steps for both *nix and Windows systems. Additionally, it introduces methods for integrating and configuring tools like go fmt, golangci-lint, goimports, and golint in Goland to help developers improve code quality and development efficiency."

## Go Environment Variables

For convenience in development, three environment variables often need to be set in the development environment:

1. `$GOROOT`: The installation directory of `go`, which remains unchanged after configuration;
2. `$GOPATH`: The project root path of the `go` project in the local development environment (for project compilation, `go build`, `go install`), this environment variable can differ for different projects during compilation;
3. `$PATH` (important): The `bin` directory of `go` needs to be added to the system `$PATH` to conveniently use related go commands, and it also remains unchanged after configuration;

There is also a detailed explanation of Go's environment variables in the official documentation, please refer to the link: [https://golang.google.cn/doc/install/source](https://golang.google.cn/doc/install/source)

> The `$GOOS` and `$GOARCH` environment variables are two very practical variables that can be used in cross-compilation for different platforms. You only need to set these two variables before `go build`, which is one of the advantages of the go language: it can compile and generate executable files that run across platforms. It feels more efficient and lightweight compared to QT, although the generated executable files are a bit larger, they are still within an acceptable range. For example, to compile an executable file for `Windows x86` under the `Linux amd64` architecture, you can use the following command:
>
> ```
> CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build hello.go
> ```
>
> Unfortunately, cross-compilation temporarily does not support the `cgo` method, so you need to set the environment variable `$CGO_ENABLED` to 0. This will generate a `hello.exe` executable file for the `windows x86` architecture in the current directory after execution.

### Environment Variable Settings

Other than the `$PATH` environment, other environment variables are optional.

Why is this step optional? Because future versions of `Go` are gradually beginning to remove support for `$GOPATH`/`$GOROOT`. In addition, there is a `Terminal` function integrated into the `Goland` IDE where the environment variables are already set.

### Setting Environment Variables on `*nix`

On `*nix` systems (such as `Linux/Unix/MacOS/*BSD`, etc.), you need to add the following environment variable settings to `/etc/profile` and then execute the command `#source /etc/profile` to reload the profile configuration file (or log in again) to add the following variables to the user's environment variables:

```bash
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=/Users/john/Workspace/Go/GOPATH
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$PATH
```

### Setting Environment Variables on `Windows`

For how to modify system environment variables and modify the `PATH` environment variable on Windows, please refer to online tutorials ([Baidu](https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=Windows%20%E4%BF%AE%E6%94%B9%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83%E5%8F%98%E9%87%8F%20PATH) or [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=Windows+修改系统环境变量+PATH)).

## IDE Tool Configuration

This article uses the `Goland` development tool as a base to introduce the configuration of common tools in this IDE.

Commonly used tools include:

1. `go fmt`: A unified code formatting tool (mandatory).
2. `golangci-lint`: A static code quality inspection tool used for package quality analysis (recommended).
3. `goimports`: An automatic `import` dependency package tool (optional).
4. `golint`: A code convention inspection tool, which also detects the quality of single-file code and is used by the well-known Go quality assessment site [Go Report](https://goreportcard.com) (optional).

### `go fmt`, `goimports`, `golangci-lint`

Since these three tools are built into `Goland`, the configuration is relatively simple. Refer to the following pictorial operation example:

1. In the `Goland` settings, select `Tools` - `File Watchers`, then choose to add

2. Add these 3 tools in turn by clicking, and use the default configuration

![Image](/markdown/23d9056527febe75f82dcc8117f086fd.jpg)

3. Subsequently, while writing code, these 3 tools will be automatically triggered for detection when you save the code files.


### Installing and Configuring `golint` Tool (Optional)

#### Installing `golint`

Since `Goland` does not come with the `golint` tool, you need to download and install it yourself first.

**If you have configured goproxy**, you can directly use `go install golang.org/x/lint/golint@latest` to install, without needing the command below.

Use the following commands to install:

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/golang.org/x/
cd $GOPATH/src/golang.org/x/
git clone https://github.com/golang/lint.git
git clone https://github.com/golang/tools.git
cd $GOPATH/src/golang.org/x/lint/golint
go install
```

After a successful installation, you will see the automatically generated `golint` binary tool file in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

#### Configuring `golint`

1. Then in the `Tools` - `File Watchers` configuration of `Goland`, by copying the configuration of `go fmt`

2. Modify the three settings `Name`, `Program`, and `Arguments`, where `Arguments` needs to add the `-set_exit_status` parameter, as shown in the figure:

3. Save, and the `golint` tool will be automatically triggered for detection when saving the code during writing.


### Configuring `golangci-lint` (Optional)

1.  Then in the `Tools` - `File Watchers` configuration of `Goland`, by copying the `go fmt` configuration![](/markdown/267c777a8db90758dd8bad6013f60d7e.png)
2. Modify the `Name`, `Program`, and `Arguments` settings, where `Arguments` needs to add the `run $FileDir$` parameter. Note: The options in `\`Advanced Options\`` can be deselected if the machine is relatively slow, as shown in the figure:![](/markdown/5bf774ae9e6d123efa9010dd223a618a.png)
3. Save, and the `golangci-lint` tool will be automatically triggered for detection when saving the code during writing.
4. Manage the configuration of `golangci-lint` tools through the `go Linter` plugin. Below is the installation and configuration of `go Linter`.![](/markdown/0f0fbd2a3a937573cdc317bbe005a6cf.png)![](/markdown/1c10390d9bfca56c0528f43f122b9ebd.png)
