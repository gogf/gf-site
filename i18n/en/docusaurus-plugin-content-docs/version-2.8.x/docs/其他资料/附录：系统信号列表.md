description: "This document lists common signals in Linux and Windows systems and their meanings, including how to handle these signals. For developers, understanding the role and reaction mechanism of each signal is crucial, especially when programming with the GoFrame framework. This article provides a convenient reference to quickly locate and understand the use of signals."
