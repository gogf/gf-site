description: "Introduces support for Boolean fields in time fields of the GoFrame framework, demonstrating through examples how to use a Boolean type 'deleted_at' field for data soft deletion. Provides MySQL table structure definition and examples of creating records and performing soft delete operations using the ORM component in GoFrame."
---

Starting from version `v2.8`, if the time fields `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `deleted_at` are Boolean fields, the ORM component will automatically recognize and support them, writing Boolean type values (represented by `0` and `1`). Typically, the Boolean field is the `deleted_at` field, and we only demonstrate the case where the `deleted_at` field is of type `bool`.

## Example SQL
This is the `MySQL` table structure used in the example code that follows.

```sql
CREATE TABLE `user` (
  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  `status` tinyint DEFAULT 0,
  `created_at` int(10) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,
  `updated_at` int(10) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,
  `deleted_at` bit(1) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
```

We recommend using `bit(1)` to represent the `bool` type for the field instead of `tinyint(1)` or `int(1)` because the range of `tinyint(1)/int(1)` is `-127~127`, which is often used as a status field type. The range of `bit(1)` is `0/1`, which can effectively represent the two values `false/true` of the `bool` type.

:::tip
If you try to test and view the `ORM` operation execution SQL statements, it is recommended to enable the `debug` mode (related documentation: [ORM Senior - Debug Mode](../../ORM高级特性/ORM高级特性-调试模式.md)), and the SQL statements will be automatically printed to the log output.

## `created_at` Write Time

```go
// INSERT INTO `user`(`name`,`created_at`,`updated_at`,`deleted_at`) VALUES('john',1731481488,1731481488,0)
g.Model("user").Data(g.Map{"name": "john"}).Insert()
```

## `deleted_at` Data Soft Deletion

```go
// UPDATE `user` SET `deleted_at`=1 WHERE (`id`=10) AND `deleted_at`=0
g.Model("user").Where("id", 10).Delete()
```

Some changes occur during the query, for example:

```go
// SELECT * FROM `user` WHERE (id>1) AND `deleted_at`=0
g.Model("user").Where("id>?", 1).All()
```
