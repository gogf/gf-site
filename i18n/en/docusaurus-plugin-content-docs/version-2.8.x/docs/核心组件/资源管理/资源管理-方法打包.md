description: "Resource management and method packing using the GoFrame framework. Implement custom methods for packaging and unpacking files and directories, supporting binary and Go code files. The examples also demonstrate how to protect resource file contents through custom encryption and decryption, providing detailed interface documentation and implementation details."

:::tip
The examples in this chapter demonstrate encryption/decryption while performing packing/unpacking. Most business projects do not actually require encryption/decryption, so direct use of tools for packing is sufficient.
:::
In the previous chapter, we introduced how to use the `gf` toolchain for file/directory packing and generate `Go` files compiled into executables. In this chapter, we introduce the methods involved in resource management and demonstrate a custom packing/unpacking feature through an example of binary resource file packing/unpacking. We also show how to use custom encryption and decryption to protect our resource file contents.

**Interface Documentation:**

[https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gres](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gres)

**Brief Introduction:**

1. The `Pack*`/ `Unpack*` methods can implement packing/unpacking for any file, packing to binary files or Go code files.
2. Resource management is implemented by the `Resource` object, which can add packed content, search files, and traverse directories.
3. Resource files are implemented by the `File` object, which is similar to the `os.File` object and implements the `http.File` interface.
4. `ScanDir` is used for file/directory search in a specific directory, supporting recursive search.
5. `ScanDirFile` is used for file search in a specific directory, supporting recursive search.
6. The `Dump` method prints out all files of the `Resource` object on the terminal, with the file separator in the resource manager unified as `/`.
7. Furthermore, the `gres` resource management module provides a default `Resource` object with package methods for operating that default object.

## Custom Packing Example

We will pack the `public` and `config` directories under the project root directory into a `data.bin` binary file, and encrypt the generated binary content using the `gaes` encryption algorithm.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/crypto/gaes"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gfile"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gres"
)

var (
    CryptoKey = []byte("x76cgqt36i9c863bzmotuf8626dxiwu0")
)

func main() {
    binContent, err := gres.Pack("public,config")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    binContent, err = gaes.Encrypt(binContent, CryptoKey)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    if err := gfile.PutBytes("data.bin", binContent); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

## Custom Unpacking Example

We will use the `data.bin` just packed, requiring decryption and unpacking operations.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/crypto/gaes"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gfile"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gres"
)

var (
    CryptoKey = []byte("x76cgqt36i9c863bzmotuf8626dxiwu0")
)

func main() {
    binContent := gfile.GetBytes("data.bin")
    binContent, err := gaes.Decrypt(binContent, CryptoKey)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    if err := gres.Add(binContent); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    gres.Dump()
}
```

Finally, we use `gres.Dump()` to print out the list of successfully added files to see if the resource files are added successfully.
