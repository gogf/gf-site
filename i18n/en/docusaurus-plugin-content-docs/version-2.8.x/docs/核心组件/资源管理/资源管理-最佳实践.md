description: "Best practices for resource management in the GoFrame framework. By using the engineering directory structure and CLI tools provided by GoFrame, developers can effectively manage static resources without affecting the development process. During the release phase, the resource components package static files into the binary executable file, achieving efficient resource release and management."

One of the goals of resource management design is not to affect the development and management of static files during the development phase, only to execute packaging at release time. Once packaging is complete, temporary files are cleaned up, so it only affects the generated binary executable file, making it imperceptible and convenient for developers to use.

## Prepare the Project

It is recommended to use the engineering directory structure officially provided by `GoFrame` and to use the `CLI` tool to create your project, as the entire framework engineering concept and some examples are based on a standardized engineering directory structure. This is more conducive to learning and using the entire development framework, improving development efficiency. In particular, there is a `packed` directory in the project directory to store the packaged content related to the resource management component. By default, it contains a blank `go` file that does nothing.

## Development Phase

During the development phase, generally, developers do not need to care about resource management; they should code as usual, and static files should be placed in the `resource` directory as suggested. In the development phase, static file access will be directly through the file system.

## Prepare for Release

After development is complete, if you wish to package static files, template files, and configuration files into the binary executable file for release alongside it, the resource component will now begin to showcase its capability. You need to configure cross-compilation settings, specifically refer to the command line section [Cross-Compiling](../../开发工具/交叉编译-build.md). We need to use the CLI tool to execute executable file compilation, managing your compile configuration through a configuration file (placed in the hack/config.yaml file). A reference compile configuration is as follows:

```
gfcli:
  build:
    name:      "my-app"
    arch:      "amd64"
    system:    "linux"
    mod:       "none"
    cgo:       0
    packSrc:   "manifest/config,manifest/i18n,resource/public,resource/template"
    version:   ""
    output:    "./bin"
    extra:     ""
```

Please note the `pack` configuration, indicating the directories to be automatically packaged into the binary executable file during compilation. Then, execute the compile command in the root directory of the project:

```
gf build
```

This command automatically packages the directories specified in the configuration file into temporary packaged `go` files during compilation, then cleans up the temporary packaged `go` files after compilation is complete.

:::tip
In most scenarios, configuration files may not need to be packaged into the binary executable file. Choose according to your business scenario.

## Release and Run

Release and execute the binary as needed.
