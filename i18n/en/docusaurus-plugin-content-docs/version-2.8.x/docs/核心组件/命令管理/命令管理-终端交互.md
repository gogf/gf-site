description: "The gcmd component in the GoFrame framework is used for interacting with users in a terminal environment. It primarily offers two core methods, Scan and Scanf, which facilitate convenient reading of user input from the terminal and interactive display in the command line interface. These practical features are suitable for the development of command-line programs that require interaction with user data input."

## Introduction

The `gcmd` component supports reading user input data from the terminal, commonly used in terminal interaction scenarios.

Related methods:

```go
func Scan(info ...interface{}) string
func Scanf(format string, info ...interface{}) string
```

Both methods display the given information to the terminal and automatically read user input from the terminal, returning it upon pressing the Enter key.

## `Scan` Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gcmd"
)

func main() {
    name := gcmd.Scan("What's your name?\n")
    fmt.Println("Your name is:", name)
}
```

After execution, interaction example:

```
> What's your name?
john
> Your name is: john
```

## `Scanf` Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gcmd"
)

func main() {
    name := gcmd.Scan("> What's your name?\n")
    age := gcmd.Scanf("> Hello %s, how old are you?\n", name)
    fmt.Printf("> %s's age is: %s", name, age)
}
```

After execution, interaction example:

```
> What's your name?
john
> Hello john, how old are you?
18
> john's age is: 18
```
