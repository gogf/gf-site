description: "Using the command management component of the GoFrame framework for tracing. Through the OpenTelemetry specification, GoFrame can achieve cross-process tracing, which is especially suitable for processes that run temporarily. The example demonstrates how to call sub-processes from the main process and automatically pass link information."

## Introduction

The `GoFrame` command management component also supports cross-process tracing features, which are particularly useful for processes that run temporarily.

The overall tracing of the framework adopts the `OpenTelemetry` specification.

## Usage Example

### Main Process

`main.go`

```go
package main

import (
    "context"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gcmd"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gctx"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gproc"
)

var (
    Main = &gcmd.Command{
        Name:  "main",
        Brief: "main process",
        Func: func(ctx context.Context, parser *gcmd.Parser) (err error) {
            g.Log().Debug(ctx, `this is main process`)
            return gproc.ShellRun(ctx, `go run sub.go`)
        },
    }
)

func main() {
    Main.Run(gctx.GetInitCtx())
}
```

### Sub Process

`sub.go`

```go
package main

import (
    "context"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gcmd"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gctx"
)

var (
    Sub = &gcmd.Command{
        Name:  "sub",
        Brief: "sub process",
        Func: func(ctx context.Context, parser *gcmd.Parser) (err error) {
            g.Log().Debug(ctx, `this is sub process`)
            return nil
        },
    }
)

func main() {
    Sub.Run(gctx.GetInitCtx())
}
```

### Execution Result

After execution, the terminal output is as follows:

```bash
$ go run main.go
2022-06-21 20:35:06.196 [DEBU] {00698a61e2a2fa1661da5d7993d72e8c} this is main process
2022-06-21 20:35:07.482 [DEBU] {00698a61e2a2fa1661da5d7993d72e8c} this is sub process
```

You can see that the link information has been automatically passed to the sub-process.
