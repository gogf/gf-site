## Introduction

In most scenarios, we manage single or multiple commands using the `Command` command line object, and the default command line parsing rules (without explicitly using the `Parser` parser) are sufficient. The `Command` object is defined as follows:

For detailed information, refer to the interface documentation: [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gcmd@master#Command](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gcmd@master#Command)

```go
// Command holds the info about an argument that can handle custom logic.
type Command struct {
    Name          string        // Command name(case-sensitive).
    Usage         string        // A brief line description about its usage, eg: gf build main.go [OPTION]
    Brief         string        // A brief info that describes what this command will do.
    Description   string        // A detailed description.
    Arguments     []Argument    // Argument array, configuring how this command act.
    Func          Function      // Custom function.
    FuncWithValue FuncWithValue // Custom function with output parameters that can interact with command caller.
    HelpFunc      Function      // Custom help function
    Examples      string        // Usage examples.
    Additional    string        // Additional info about this command, which will be appended to the end of help info.
    Strict        bool          // Strict parsing options, which means it returns error if invalid option given.
    Config        string        // Config node name, which also retrieves the values from config component along with command line.
    parent        *Command      // Parent command for internal usage.
    commands      []*Command    // Sub commands of this command.
}
```

As each object has detailed comments, we will not elaborate further here.

## Callback Methods

The `Command` object supports `3` callback methods:

- `Func`: We usually customize this callback method to implement the command execution operation.
- `FuncWithValue`: Method similar to `Func`, but supports return values, often used in scenarios where command lines call each other. Typically not needed in general projects.
- `HelpFunc`: Custom help information. Generally unnecessary, as the `Command` object can automatically generate help information.

We focus mainly on the `Func` callback method. Other methods can be explored if interested.

## `Func` Callback

Method definition:

```go
// Function is a custom command callback function that is bound to a certain argument.
type Function func(ctx context.Context, parser *Parser) (err error)
```

As seen, within the callback method, we use the `parser` object to obtain parsing parameters and options and return `error` to inform the upper-level calling method whether the execution was successful.

Example usage:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/ghttp"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gcmd"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gctx"
)

var (
    Main = &gcmd.Command{
        Name:        "main",
        Brief:       "start http server",
        Description: "this is the command entry for starting your http server",
        Func: func(ctx context.Context, parser *gcmd.Parser) (err error) {
            s := g.Server()
            s.BindHandler("/", func(r *ghttp.Request) {
                r.Response.Write("Hello world")
            })
            s.SetPort(8199)
            s.Run()
            return
        },
    }
)

func main() {
    Main.Run(gctx.New())
}
```

This is what most projects’ command line objects for starting up would look like. Most projects have only one entry point and only one callback method implementation.

## Help Information Generation

Although the `Command` object can customize the `HelpFunc` help callback method, the `Command` object can automatically generate `Help` usage help information. In most scenarios, customization is unnecessary. Moreover, the `gcmd` component has built-in support for `h/help` options by default, so programs using the `gcmd` component can automatically generate `Help` help information using these two options.

Let’s look at an example. We first build the previous example into a binary `main` file using `go build main.go`, and then take a quick look at the automatically generated help information when there is only one command:

```bash
$ ./main -h
USAGE
    main [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
    this is the command entry for starting your http server
```

## Hierarchical Command Management

### Parent Commands and Subcommands

A `Command` command can add subcommands. When a `Command` has subcommands, it becomes a parent command. Subcommands can also add their own subcommands, forming a hierarchical command relationship. Both parent commands and subcommands can have their own callback methods, but in most scenarios, once a `Command` becomes a parent command, callback methods often become unnecessary. We typically add subcommands to a `Command` using the `AddCommand` method:

```go
// AddCommand adds one or more sub-commands to current command.
func (c *Command) AddCommand(commands ...*Command) error
```

### Hierarchical Command Usage Example

Let us demonstrate an example of multi-command management. We will improve the previous example by adding two subcommands.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gcmd"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gctx"
)

var (
    Main = &gcmd.Command{
        Name:        "main",
        Brief:       "start http server",
        Description: "this is the command entry for starting your process",
    }
    Http = &gcmd.Command{
        Name:        "http",
        Brief:       "start http server",
        Description: "this is the command entry for starting your http server",
        Func: func(ctx context.Context, parser *gcmd.Parser) (err error) {
            fmt.Println("start http server")
            return
        },
    }
    Grpc = &gcmd.Command{
        Name:        "grpc",
        Brief:       "start grpc server",
        Description: "this is the command entry for starting your grpc server",
        Func: func(ctx context.Context, parser *gcmd.Parser) (err error) {
            fmt.Println("start grpc server")
            return
        },
    }
)

func main() {
    err := Main.AddCommand(Http, Grpc)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    Main.Run(gctx.New())
}
```

As seen, we use the `AddCommand` command to add two subcommands `http/grpc` to the main command, used respectively for starting `http/grpc` services. When subcommands exist, parent command often has no need for a `Func` callback definition, so we removed the `Func` definition of the `main` command here.

After compilation, let us execute to see the effect:

```bash
$ main
USAGE
    main COMMAND [OPTION]

COMMAND
    http    start http server
    grpc    start grpc server

DESCRIPTION
    this is the command entry for starting your process
```

Using the `http` command:

```bash
$ main http
start http server
```

Using the `grpc` command:

```bash
$ main grpc
start grpc server
```
