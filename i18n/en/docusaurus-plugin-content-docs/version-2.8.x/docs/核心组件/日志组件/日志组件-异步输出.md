description: "Use the GoFrame framework for asynchronous log output to improve logging efficiency. You can set asynchronous output using SetAsync or chaining methods. Asynchronous output can reduce resource usage, but be aware of potential log disorder issues."
---

For log output with low immediacy requirements, you can output logs asynchronously. Asynchronous output allows logging calls to return immediately, thus being more efficient. `glog` certainly supports asynchronous output features and uses a `goroutine` pool internally to manage asynchronous log printing tasks, which can significantly reduce resource usage.

Asynchronous output can be implemented through the `SetAsync`/ `SetFlags` methods of the log object or through the chaining operation `Async` method. However, note that if you set asynchronous output through the object setting methods, all subsequent log outputs will be asynchronous; if you output asynchronously through chaining, only the current log output will be asynchronous.
:::warning
If both synchronous and asynchronous printing are used for the same file log output, please note the log file content may become disordered, which should be avoided as much as possible.

### `SetAsync`

Let's look at an example of implementing asynchronous printing using the `SetAsync` method.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "time"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.TODO()
    g.Log().SetAsync(true)
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        g.Log().Print(ctx, "async log", i)
    }
}
```

After execution, you can find nothing is output to the terminal because the log output is asynchronous, and the example exits before the log content is output. Therefore, we can make a slight improvement as follows:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "time"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.TODO()
    g.Log().SetAsync(true)
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        g.Log().Print(ctx, "async log", i)
    }
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```

After execution, the terminal output is:

```html
2019-06-02 15:44:21.399 async log 0
2019-06-02 15:44:21.399 async log 1
2019-06-02 15:44:21.399 async log 2
2019-06-02 15:44:21.399 async log 3
2019-06-02 15:44:21.399 async log 4
2019-06-02 15:44:21.399 async log 5
2019-06-02 15:44:21.399 async log 6
2019-06-02 15:44:21.399 async log 7
2019-06-02 15:44:21.399 async log 8
2019-06-02 15:44:21.399 async log 9
```

### `Async` Chaining Operation

The chaining operation is relatively simple.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "time"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.TODO()
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        g.Log().Async().Print(ctx, "async log", i)
    }
    g.Log().Print(ctx, "normal log")
    g.Log().Print(ctx, "normal log")
    g.Log().Print(ctx, "normal log")
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```

After execution, the terminal output is:

```html
2022-01-05 15:00:44.101 normal log
2022-01-05 15:00:44.101 async log 0
2022-01-05 15:00:44.101 async log 1
2022-01-05 15:00:44.101 async log 2

2022-01-05 15:00:44.101 async log 5
2022-01-05 15:00:44.101 async log 6
2022-01-05 15:00:44.101 async log 7
2022-01-05 15:00:44.101 async log 8
2022-01-05 15:00:44.101 async log 9
2022-01-05 15:00:44.101 normal log
2022-01-05 15:00:44.103 normal log
```
