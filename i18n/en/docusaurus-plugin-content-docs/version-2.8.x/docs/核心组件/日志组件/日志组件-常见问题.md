## How to print the stack of an `error` variable rather than the stack at the time the log method is called

Using the following method will only print the string description of the `error`, and the stack is just the stack at the time the log method `Error` is called:

```go
g.Log().Error(ctx, err)
```

If you want to print the stack of the `error` variable, and not the stack when the `Error` method is called, you can do it as follows:

```go
g.Log().Printf(ctx, "%+v", err)
```
