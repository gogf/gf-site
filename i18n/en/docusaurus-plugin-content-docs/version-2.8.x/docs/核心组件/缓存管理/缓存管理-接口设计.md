description: "The interface design and implementation of the cache management component in the GoFrame framework provide the Adapter interface, allowing developers to flexibly register and customize cache management objects, achieving seamless integration of different caching strategies. It details how to register and obtain interface implementations through SetAdapter and GetAdapter methods."
---

The cache component adopts an interface design, providing the `Adapter` interface. Any object implementing the `Adapter` interface can be registered into the cache management object, allowing developers to flexibly customize and extend the cache management object.

## Interface Definition

The `Adapter` interface is defined as follows:

[https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gcache#Adapter](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gcache#Adapter)

## Registering Interface Implementation

This method applies the implemented `adapter` to the corresponding `Cache` object:

```go
// SetAdapter changes the adapter for this cache.
// Be very note that, this setting function is not concurrent-safe, which means you should not call
// this setting function concurrently in multiple goroutines.
func (c *Cache) SetAdapter(adapter Adapter)
```

For specific examples, please refer to the [Caching - Redis](缓存管理-Redis缓存.md) section.

## Obtaining Interface Implementation

This method retrieves the currently registered `adapter` interface implementation object:

```go
// GetAdapter returns the adapter that is set in current Cache.
func (c *Cache) GetAdapter() Adapter
```

For specific examples, please refer to the [Caching - Redis](缓存管理-Redis缓存.md) section.
