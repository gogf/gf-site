description: "How to use custom objects as template variables in the template engine, and access object properties and call methods within the template. This is explained in detail through examples, illustrating how to implement template content parsing in the GoFrame framework, as well as the differences between using object pointers and object variables, and the rules for method calls, helping developers better master the templating technology in the GoFrame framework."

## Built-in Variables

Please refer to the [Response - Template Parsing](../../WEB服务开发/数据返回/数据返回-模板解析.md) section for `WebServer` built-in variables.

## Variable Objects

We can use custom objects in templates and access the properties of objects and invoke their methods within the template.

Example:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
)

type T struct {
    Name string
}

func (t *T) Hello(name string) string {
    return "Hello " + name
}

func (t *T) Test() string {
    return "This is test"
}

func main() {
    t := &T{"John"}
    v := g.View()
    content := `{{.t.Hello "there"}}, my name's {{.t.Name}}. {{.t.Test}}.`
    if r, err := v.ParseContent(context.TODO(), content, g.Map{"t": t}); err != nil {
        g.Dump(err)
    } else {
        g.Dump(r)
    }
}
```

Here, the variables assigned to the template can be either `object pointers` or `object variables`. However, note the defined object methods: if it is an object pointer, you can only call methods where the receiver is an object pointer; if it is an object variable, you can only call methods where the receiver is an object.

After execution, the output is:

```
Hello there, my name's John. This is test.
```
