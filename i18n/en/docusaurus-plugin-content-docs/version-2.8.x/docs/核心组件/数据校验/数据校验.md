## Introduction

The `goframe` framework provides a powerful, easy-to-use, flexible, and easily extensible data/form validation component implemented by the `gvalid` component. The `gvalid` component implements a very powerful data validation functionality, with dozens of built-in common validation rules. It supports single data multiple rule validation, multi-data multi-rule batch validation, custom error messages, custom regular expression validation, custom validation rule registration, supports `i18n` internationalization processing, supports `struct tag` rules and prompt information binding and other features, making it currently the most powerful `Go` data validation module.
