:::info
Starting from version `v2`, the latest version of the `CLI` tool features will be compiled with the latest version of the `GoFrame` framework. If there is a compatibility issue between the auto-generated code of the local `CLI` tool and the project's `GoFrame` framework version, it is recommended to upgrade the project framework version or customize the installation of an older version of the `CLI` tool. For the installation method of the old version of the CLI tool, refer to the repository homepage introduction: [https://github.com/gogf/gf-cli](https://github.com/gogf/gf-cli)

## Important NoteðŸ”¥

- The code generation function provided by the `CLI` tool aims to **standardize project code writing**, **simplify project development complexity**, and **allow developers to focus on business logic itself**.
- The `CLI` tool itself requires a certain degree of prior learning and understanding cost (try to understand why), but once proficient, everyone's development work will be twice as effective with half the effort.
- The code generation function of the `CLI` tool will be highly beneficial for enterprise-level projects and multi-member team projects. However, for small single-person projects, developers can evaluate whether to use it based on personal preference. The `GoFrame` framework itself only provides basic components and adopts a modular and flexible design without strict requirements on project code; however, the `CLI` tool will have some restrictions to ensure that each member of the team maintains consistent pace and style, preventing developers from writing code too freely.
