Hello friends, after a year of hard work, it's been a while since we've had a technical sharing!

This Thursday at 8 PM `GOCN` Open Source Talk will feature the topic `Let's GoFrame`, mainly introducing some core designs, functional features, and practical demonstrations of the `GoFrame` framework.

`GoFrame` is a modular, high-performance, enterprise-level `Go` foundational development framework. If you want to use `Golang` to develop a business project, whether it's small or medium to large scale, `GoFrame` is your top choice. If you're looking to develop a `Golang` component library, `GoFrame` provides an out-of-the-box, rich and powerful basic component library that can make your work more efficient.

`GoFrame` offers a unified and practical engineering development standard and supporting tools, automatic data model and database operation code generation, automatic `OpenAPIv3` document generation, support for `OpenTelemetry` observability standards, full error stack features, support for error codes, full API design of core components, and more. Using `GoFrame`'s out-of-the-box basic components, rich development documentation, practical tools, and standards can help us focus our energy on the business itself, write more standardized, secure, and observable code, improve project development and maintenance efficiency, and enable teams and individuals to create more value.
