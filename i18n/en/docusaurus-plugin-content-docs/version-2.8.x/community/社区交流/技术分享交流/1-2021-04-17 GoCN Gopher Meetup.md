Hello everyone, a new round of `GoFrame` framework technical sharing is here!

This time, it was a technical sharing event in the `Golang` field held by `GoCN` and `Tap4Fun` in Chengdu, and I was honored to be invited as one of the speakers.

The theme of this technical sharing remains focused on introducing framework design, with the following being the reference directory:

For more introductions related to `GoFrame` design, you can refer to the chapter on [Framework Design](../../../docs/框架设计/框架设计.md).

Due to time constraints, the introduction on microservices development, which everyone is more interested in, will be shared in subsequent events.
