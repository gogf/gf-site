Hello everyone!

To fulfill our promise to the community, we plan to hold the first `GoFrame` technical sharing (online meetup)! The theme of this sharing is: **Introduction and Design of the GoFrame Framework**.

At the same time, we will also have a face-to-face interaction session between developers and the author, with ample time reserved for discussion. Everyone is encouraged to prepare questions they wish to ask.

To ensure a good discussion experience, the Q&A session will use Tencent Meeting. Please join the meeting in advance if you intend to ask questions.
