## Quick Review

Congratulations! By now, you should be familiar with:

1. Setting up a GoFrame project
2. Understanding application startup flow
3. Grasping the framework's architectural principles
4. Building a basic API service

## Learning Path

Let's explore your options for diving deeper into GoFrame.

### Community Resources

Our community members have created excellent learning materials to help you succeed. Check out our [Community Tutorials](../../course/社区教程.md) for practical insights and tips.

### Mastering Service Development

Most developers use GoFrame for one of two primary purposes: building web applications or microservices.

#### Web Application Development

If you're focused on HTTP-based web applications, head over to our [Web Service Development Guide](../../docs/WEB服务开发/WEB服务开发.md).

This comprehensive guide walks you through web service development and related components in a progressive, easy-to-follow manner.

#### Microservice Development

For those interested in building microservices, our [Microservice Development Guide](../../docs/微服务开发/微服务开发.md) is your next stop.

Learn how to leverage GoFrame's features to build robust, scalable microservices architectures.

### Framework Components Deep Dive

Whether you're troubleshooting an unfamiliar component or using GoFrame as a component library, we've got you covered with detailed documentation.

#### Core Components

Our core components are essential building blocks used in most projects. They're crucial for mastering the framework. Start here: [Core Components ](../../docs/核心组件/核心组件.md)

#### Component Directory

For a complete overview of all available components, check out our [Components Category](../../docs/组件列表/组件列表.md).
