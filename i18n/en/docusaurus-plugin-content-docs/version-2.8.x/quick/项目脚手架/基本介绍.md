In this chapter, we'll walk you through building a complete API project using GoFrame's scaffolding tools.

:::warning
**Important Note:** GoFrame is a professional-grade, engineered development framework for Go that's thoughtfully designed, easy to use, and backed by comprehensive documentation and an active community. **Once you experience the productivity benefits of GoFrame, you'll never want to go back to manual development**.

If you encounter any challenges while following this quick start guide, feel free to drop a comment in the discussion section üí¨. We're here to help and will provide solutions as quickly as possible üåüüåü.

## Installing the Framework Tools

GoFrame provides a suite of development tools that streamline your workflow with convenient commands for project scaffolding, code generation, and framework updates. You can download these tools from: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/releases](https://github.com/gogf/gf/releases)

### Pre-compiled Installation

We offer pre-compiled binaries hosted on GitHub for immediate use across different platforms.

#### macOS Installation

```bash
wget -O gf "https://github.com/gogf/gf/releases/latest/download/gf_$(go env GOOS)_$(go env GOARCH)" && chmod +x gf && ./gf install -y && rm ./gf
```

Common installation issues and solutions:

- If `wget` is missing, install it using `brew install wget`
- üî• For `zsh` users: There might be a conflict with the `gf` alias (git fetch). After installation, **restart your terminal** to resolve this
- Missing Go environment variables: Ensure your Go development environment is properly set up by following our [Environment Setup Guide](../../docs/ÂÖ∂‰ªñËµÑÊñô/ÂáÜÂ§áÂºÄÂèëÁéØÂ¢É/ÂáÜÂ§áÂºÄÂèëÁéØÂ¢É.md)
- For other issues, try the Source Code Installation method below

#### Linux Installation

```bash
wget -O gf "https://github.com/gogf/gf/releases/latest/download/gf_$(go env GOOS)_$(go env GOARCH)" && chmod +x gf && ./gf install -y && rm ./gf
```

If `wget` is not installed:
- `Ubuntu/Debian:` `apt-get install wget -y`
- `CentOS/RedHat:` `yum install wget -y`


#### Windows Installation

Download the appropriate binary file and run it. If the installation fails, use the Source Code Installation method instead.

### Source Code Installation

For a universal installation method, compile from source using `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/gogf/gf/cmd/gf/v2@latest
```

### Verifying Your Installation

Run `gf -v` to verify the installation. A successful installation will show output similar to this:

```html
$ gf -v
v2.7.4
Welcome to GoFrame!
Env Detail:
  Go Version: go1.23.1 darwin/arm64
  GF Version(go.mod): cannot find go.mod
CLI Detail:
  Installed At: /Users/john/go/bin/gf
  Built Go Version: go1.23.1
  Built GF Version: v2.7.4
Others Detail:
  Docs: https://goframe.org
  Now : 2024-10-29T13:30:30+08:00
```

Note: The `Go/GF Version` shows the versions used to build the binary, while `GoFrame Version` indicates the framework version used in your current project (detected from `go.mod`).

:::info
Important Note: üî• If you're using `zsh`, remember to restart your terminal after installation to resolve any potential `gf` alias conflicts with `git fetch`.
:::

## Creating a Project

```bash
gf init demo -u
```

This command creates a project scaffold named `demo`. The `-u` flag updates the project's GoFrame dependencies to their latest versions. GoFrame uses a unique project structure optimized for various development scenarios. For detailed information about the project structure, see: [Project Structure Guideüî•](../../docs/Ê°ÜÊû∂ËÆæËÆ°/Â∑•Á®ãÂºÄÂèëËÆæËÆ°/Â∑•Á®ãÁõÆÂΩïËÆæËÆ°.md).

The scaffold provides a versatile structure suitable for web applications, CLI tools, and microservices. By default, it generates an HTTP Web Server template. After understanding the directory structure, feel free to remove any unnecessary directories.

## Running Your Project

Start your project with this command:

```bash
cd demo && gf run main.go
```

The `gf run` command enables hot-reloading during development. You can also use standard `go run` if preferred.

You'll see output similar to:

```text
$ cd demo && gf run main.go
build: main.go
go build -o ./main  main.go
./main
build running pid: 76159

```

By default, your application will:
- Run on port `8000`
- Enable `OpenAPI` documentation
- Provide a `Swagger UI` interface
- Display all route information in the terminal
- Include a sample `/hello` endpoint

Try accessing: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello](http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello)

## Upgrading the Framework

To update to the latest framework version, run this command in your project's root directory (where `go.mod` is located):

```bash
gf up -a
```
