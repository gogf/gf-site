The `GoFrame` framework provides a standardized routing approach that simplifies route registration and lets developers focus on business logic. We call this **Standard Routing** - a more intuitive and maintainable way to handle HTTP endpoints.

## Defining Request/Response Types

Standard routing uses structured types for both requests and responses. This approach enables parameter validation, documentation generation, and future extensibility:

```go 
type HelloReq struct {
    g.Meta `path:"/" method:"get"`
    Name   string `v:"required" dc:"User's name"`
    Age    int    `v:"required" dc:"User's age"`
}
type HelloRes struct {}
```

Key components:
- The request struct embeds `g.Meta` with routing metadata tags:
  - `path`: The URL path to register
  - `method`: The HTTP method to handle (GET, POST, etc.)
- Field tags provide additional functionality:
  - `v`: Validation rules (short for "valid"). Here, `v:"required"` marks fields as mandatory
  - `dc`: Documentation comments (short for "description") for API docs

## Object-Oriented Route Handlers

For better maintainability, especially in larger APIs, we use an object-oriented approach instead of registering routes one by one. Here's how it works:

```go
type Hello struct{}

func (Hello) Say(ctx context.Context, req *HelloReq) (res *HelloRes, err error) {
    r := g.RequestFromCtx(ctx)
    r.Response.Writef(
        "Hello %s! Your Age is %d",
        req.Name,
        req.Age,
    )
    return
}
```

Benefits of this approach:
- Routes are organized into logical groups via handler objects
- Method signatures are more idiomatic and business-focused compared to raw `func(*ghttp.Request)` handlers
- The original request object is still accessible via `g.RequestFromCtx` when needed

## Complete Example

Here's how we'd rewrite our web server using standard routing:

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
    "context"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/ghttp"
)

type HelloReq struct {
    g.Meta `path:"/" method:"get"`
    Name   string `v:"required" dc:"User's name"`
    Age    int    `v:"required" dc:"User's age"`
}
type HelloRes struct{}

type Hello struct{}

func (Hello) Say(ctx context.Context, req *HelloReq) (res *HelloRes, err error) {
    r := g.RequestFromCtx(ctx)
    r.Response.Writef(
        "Hello %s! Your Age is %d",
        req.Name,
        req.Age,
    )
    return
}

func main() {
    s := g.Server()
    s.Group("/", func(group *ghttp.RouterGroup) {
        group.Bind(
            new(Hello),
        )
    })
    s.SetPort(8000)
    s.Run()
}
```

Key points:
- `s.Group` creates a route group with a common prefix ("`/`" in this case)
- `group.Bind` registers all public methods of our handler object automatically, using struct metadata to configure routes

## Testing the API

Let's test with valid parameters at http://127.0.0.1:8000/?name=john&age=18:

![img.png](img.png)

When we try an invalid request at http://127.0.0.1:8000/, we get no output. This is because the validation failed before reaching our handler - the server rejected the request due to missing required parameters.

## What's Next?

While we've improved our routing structure, we still need better control over error handling. For example, how can we:
- Capture and customize validation error messages?
- Format error responses consistently?

We'll tackle these questions in the next chapter.
