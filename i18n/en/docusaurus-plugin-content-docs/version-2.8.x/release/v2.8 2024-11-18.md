We are pleased to announce the official release of `GoFrame` version `v2.8.0`! This update brings significant improvements and new features, enhancing `GoFrame` in terms of development efficiency, execution performance, stability, and extensibility.

## Version Highlights

1. **Compatibility Update**
   - `GoFrame v2.8.0` requires a minimum `Golang` version of `1.20` to provide more efficient performance and stability.
   - The `container/gring` component has been deprecated, and the `contrib/trace/jaeger` component has been removed from the source code repository, simplifying dependency management.

2. **Component Improvements**
   - The `database/gdb` module now supports `created_at/updated_at/deleted_at` integer timestamp fields, `unix socket` connections, `time/year` field types, and introduces the `Model.Exist` method, significantly improving the flexibility and efficiency of database operations.
   - The `util/gconv` component leverages type caching to enhance conversion performance, with conversion performance for complex data types improved by approximately `300%`.
   - The `net/ghttp` and `net/gudp` network service components have optimized parameter configurations and request processing logic, providing a more streamlined development experience.

3. **Development Tools Upgrade**
   - The `gf init` command supports generating a multi-application project structure within a single repository.
   - Optimizations to commands like `gf gen ctrl`, `gf gen dao`, and `gf run`, further enhance code generation flexibility and execution efficiency, simplifying project setup processes.

4. **Community Component Support**
   - Added support for the latest features in multiple community drivers such as `contrib/drivers/mssql` and `contrib/registry/etcd`, improving integration with external services.

## Future Outlook

The `GoFrame` team thanks all community users for their support. We will continue to listen to community feedback to provide users with richer features and more efficient development support.

## Special Thanks

💖💖💖 Thanks to all the contributing developers for this release 💖💖💖

## Component Improvements
1. `database/gdb`
   - Time maintenance features have been enhanced to support integer fields. When `created_at/updated_at/deleted_at` are integer fields, they will be updated with timestamps. For details, see: [ORM Model - Time Fields](../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM链式操作/ORM链式操作-时间维护/ORM链式操作-时间维护.md)
   - Added the `Model.Exist` method to determine if data that meets given conditions exists: [Model Query - Exist](../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM链式操作/ORM链式操作-数据查询/ORM查询-Exist.md)
   - Added support for `time/year` field types in the database: [ORM Senior - Type Recognition](../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM高级特性/ORM高级特性-类型识别.md)
   - Added the `OrderRandomFunction` interface method, implemented and supported the `OrderRandom` sorting method for common databases.
   - Improved the `Model.Fields` method to support `gdb.Raw` type parameters: [ORM Model - Fields Retrieval](../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM链式操作/ORM链式操作-字段获取.md)
   - Enhanced the `With` feature in `orm` tags to support `unscoped`: [Model Association - With](../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM链式操作/ORM链式操作-模型关联/模型关联-静态关联-With特性.md)
   - Added support for `unix socket` local database service connections in the configuration file.
   - Removed `sql` statements from trace information to reduce the size of the `trace` package.
   - Improved performance of query result conversion to `struct`.

2. `net/ghttp`
   - Removed `XxxReq/XxxRes` naming restrictions for input and output objects in route registrations.
   - Adjusted the port parameter of `StartPProfServer` from `port int` to `address string` for increased flexibility.
   - Removed request/response data from trace information to reduce the size of the `trace` package.
   - Fixed graceful shutdown issues with the `/debug/admin/shutdown` interface.

3. `net/goai`
   - Allowed specifying parameter types in request/response structure attributes using the `type` tag.

4. `container/gtree`
   - Refactored `gtree` implementation using the third-party data structure component `github.com/emirpasic/gods` to enhance extensibility and maintainability.

5. `encoding/gjson`
   - Adjusted `Load*` method parameters from `interface{}` to `[]byte` to improve performance.

6. `os/gcron`
   - Added `StopGracefully` method to allow waiting for currently executing scheduled tasks to complete before stopping: [Cron Job - Usage](../docs/组件列表/系统相关/定时任务-gcron/定时任务-基本使用.md)

7. `os/gfsnotify`
   - Improved file recursive monitoring implementation so that when a directory is being monitored, newly created subdirectories within it, or their subdirectories, will also be recursively monitored: [File Watching](../docs/组件列表/系统相关/文件监控-gfsnotify/文件监控-gfsnotify.md)

8. `test/gtest`
   - Improved `AssertIN/AssertNI` assertion methods by adding support for substring containment assertions.

9. `util/gvalid`
   - Added `required-if-all` validation rule, where a parameter is mandatory if all specified parameters and their values are equal: [Data Validation - Rules](../docs/核心组件/数据校验/数据校验-校验规则.md)
   - Enhanced `phone` validation rule by adding support for `171` series phone numbers.

10. `util/gconv`
    - Enhanced conversion performance with type caching, improving conversion performance for complex data types by approximately `300%`.

## Community Components
1. `drivers/mssql`
   - Changed the base `driver` from `github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb` to the official component `github.com/microsoft/go-mssqldb`.

2. `contrib/drivers/pgsql`

5. `contrib/rpc/grpcx`
   - Removed request/response data from trace information to reduce the size of the `trace` package.
   - Since the `grpc` component has enabled the `grpc.Dial` method, `grpc.NewClient` is now used to replace `grpc.Dial`.

6. `contrib/sdk/httpclient`
   - Added `Handler` interface to allow users to customize the handling of `HTTP Client` return data.

## Development Tools
1. Improved the `gf init` command by adding the `-a/monoApp` option for creating new application project templates in a large repository: [Project Scaffold](../docs/开发工具/项目创建-init.md)

2. Enhanced the `gf pack` command by adding support for command parameter options from a configuration file, with the configuration path as `gfcli.pack`.

3. Enhanced the `gf tpl` command by adding support for command parameter options from a configuration file, with the configuration path as `gfcli.tpl.parse`.

4. Improved the `gf gen ctrl` command by re-implementing parsing logic using `AST`, increasing the accuracy of generated `Go` code file content, and enhancing the extensibility of the feature.

5. Improved the `gf run` command:
   - Added support for command parameter options from a configuration file, with the configuration path as `gfcli.run`.
   - Automatically deletes temporary old process binary files when a new process replaces the old one at the end of a temporary subprocess.

6. Improved the `gf gen dao` command:
   - Added `field mapping` feature to support specifying field configurations for generated `Golang` data types: [Dao/Do/Entity Generating](../docs/开发工具/代码生成-gen/数据规范-gen%20dao.md)
   - Automatically identifies integer fields with a length of `1`, such as `bit(1)/tinyint(1)/int(1)`, as `bool` type `Golang` data types.
   - Automatically reads the directory name of generated code files as the package name for generating `dao/do/entity` files.
   - Due to database restrictions, the `cli` has removed default support for the `dm` database. If needed, please manually modify the source code to install `cli`.
   - Fixed the issue where the `link` parameter becomes invalid when both the `link` parameter and configuration file exist simultaneously.
