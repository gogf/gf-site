description: "The GoFrame Framework v2.2.0 release includes a restructured validation component and improved database component interface design, with support for Dameng Database and new configuration center implementations. Thanks to over 44 code contributors, the GoFrame framework is becoming more powerful and flexible."
---

👋 Hi, friends! The `GoFrame` framework `v2.2.0` was officially released today!

The major highlights of this version include:

- The validation component, most frequently used by developers, has been restructured and improved, making it easier for community developers to develop and maintain built-in validation rules. It also enhances some common validation rules, making the component's built-in rules richer and stronger.
- The database component interface design has been reconstructed, making it easier for community developers to add a new database type `driver`. Currently, the framework provides `9` types of database `driver` implementations through community components, meeting the needs of most business projects. Notably, this version adds support for the domestic Dameng Database. We hope that in the future, community developers can provide more `driver` implementations for domestic databases and contribute to the open-source community.
- The richness of community components is expanded by adding `3` types of configuration center interface implementations in this release, supporting `Apollo/Polaris/Kubernetes ConfigMap`. The `GoFrame` framework adopts a modular low-coupling design, with components split into the main framework library and community components. The main framework library provides core, general, and lightweight basic components, while the community components are standalone packages decoupled from the main framework library, expanding the capabilities of the framework while ensuring the core's lightness.
- With over `44` code contributors in this release, the total number of contributors to the framework has reached `107`. We appreciate everyone's efforts and contributions to the community! 💖
