Hello everyone, the `v2.1` release includes some business-related function features, improvements, and bug fixes. It's recommended to upgrade.

Video Introduction: [2022-06-22 GoFrame v2.1 Features & Q&A](../community/社区交流/技术分享交流/5-2022-06-22%20GoFrame%20v2.1功能特性&使用答疑.md)

## New Features

1. The development tool introduces the `gen service` command, supporting automated generation of `service` interface code and implementation injection based on the `logic` layer code: [Service Generating](../docs/开发工具/代码生成-gen/模块规范-gen%20service.md)
2. Database Features:
1. Added `WhereBuilder` feature for more flexible `SQL` condition statement combinations: [Model Query - Where](../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM链式操作/ORM链式操作-数据查询/ORM查询-Where条件.md)
2. Added `Hook` feature for custom hook event handling: [ORM Model - Hook](../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM链式操作/ORM链式操作-Hook特性.md)
3. The framework adds a `DeepCopy` feature for deep copying of types:
1. Added `gutil.Copy` method for deep copying specified content.
2. Generic types add a `Copy` method for deep copying their own content.
3. Some data types of the framework now support the deep copy feature, such as basic container types like `gvar, garray, gmap`.

## Major Improvements

### Community Components

**ORM Driver Implementation**

1. Added `drivers/clickhouse` for hooking `clickhouse` to the `goframe ORM` component.
2. Complete unit tests for `clickhouse/mssql/pgsql/sqlite/oracle` components.
3. Moved the `mysql` driver from the main library to the community module to facilitate decoupling from the main library. Therefore, from subsequent versions, developers need to manually import driver dependencies: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/drivers](https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/drivers)

3. `glog`
1. Added a global `Handler` setting function, allowing developers to globally customize handling of all logs of the `glog` component, such as globally outputting in the `JSON` file format: [Logging - Handler](../docs/核心组件/日志组件/日志组件-Handler.md)
2. Added the default `JSON` format `Handler` for developers to use: [Logging - Handler](../docs/核心组件/日志组件/日志组件-Handler.md)
4. `gsession`
1. Resolved excessive memory usage issues caused by too many user accesses.
5. `gproc`

### Container Components

1. `garray`
1. Improved the `Unique` method performance, added `DeepCopy` interface implementation.
2. `glist`
1. Added `DeepCopy` interface implementation.
3. `gmap`
1. Added `DeepCopy` interface implementation.
4. `gset`

## Development Tools

Compared to the stable code components of the main library, CLI development tools have some incompatible updates in recent versions. Please pay attention to release records during upgrades; details are available in the source code adjustments.

2. Improved `docker` command, supporting multiple `docker tag` renaming and automatic repository pushing.
3. Improved `gen dao` command, supporting custom `dao/do/entity` code generation directory, no longer forced to generate in the `service/internal` directory: [Dao/Do/Entity Generating](../docs/开发工具/代码生成-gen/数据规范-gen%20dao.md)
4. Added `gen service` command, supporting automated generation of `service` interface code based on `logic` layer code: [Service Generating](../docs/开发工具/代码生成-gen/模块规范-gen%20service.md)
5. Fixed issues with the `run` command's custom program startup parameters, `gofmt/goimports` program path containing spaces.

## Incompatibilities

1. Moved the `mysql` driver from the main library to the community module to facilitate decoupling from the main library. Therefore, from subsequent versions, developers need to manually import driver dependencies: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/drivers](https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/drivers)
2. The `ghttp.Response.WriteJson/Xml` methods no longer return `error`. Adjust according to the compilation error.
3. The `goai` component moved from the `protocol` category to the `net` category, changing the `import` path. Adjust according to the compilation error.
4. Database `ORM` operations with `gtime.Time` type parameters will automatically convert them to `time.Time` type before submission to the underlying database `driver` to solve the precision loss issue. This means that `gtime.Time` type parameters are also affected by the database configuration's timezone parameters. For details, see: [ORM - Timezone](../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM时区处理.md)
