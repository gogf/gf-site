Hello everyone, the `GoFrame` framework has officially released version `v2.5.0` today! 👏👏👏👏

This version mainly focuses on improvements to existing functional components and development tools, including:

- The development tool introduces a new `gf gen ctrl` command to standardize the definition and development of API interfaces, and generate code for controllers and SDKs to improve development efficiency, addressing issues of interface standardization and efficiency in `Golang` project development. For details, please refer to: [Controller Generating](../docs/开发工具/代码生成-gen/接口规范-gen%20ctrl.md).
- The existing `gf gen dao` command adds a `TypeMapping` feature, allowing developers to customize the `Golang` type of entity object properties generated from database tables: [Dao/Do/Entity Generating](../docs/开发工具/代码生成-gen/数据规范-gen%20dao.md)

For other changes, please refer to the following `change log`. `Enjoy!` 🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺

## Feature Improvements

1. `gdb`
    1. Improved `ORM SQL` logging, with operations executed according to the order defined in the table fields.
    2. Improved `HOOK` method implementation, now supports modifying the `Table` field in the `in` parameter to change the executed table name.
    3. Added `AllAndCount/ScanAndCount` methods for convenient pagination query scenarios.
    4. Added `Model.WhereOrNot/WhereOrPrefixNot` condition methods.
2. `gi18n`
    1. Improved support for Chinese ( `Unicode` ) as key names for translation.
3. `gclient`
    1. Added `Discovery` chain operation method for setting service discovery components for the current request.
4. `ghttp`
    1. Improved request `Context` processing, where each change in `Context` will affect the underlying `http.Request` object. This supports custom `HTTP Handler` data interaction scenarios.
    2. Added support for `Endpoints` configuration item to customize the service registration discovery address of the `Server`, allowing the use of the currently listening address.
5. `goai`
    1. Improved parameter validation recognition, marking required parameters in the `OpenAPIv3` results.
6. `gsel`
    1. Fixed locking mechanism issues for `Endpoints` updates in the `RoundRobin` implementation.
7. `glog`
    1. Added `TimeFormat` configuration for customizing the time format of log output: [Logging - Configuration](../docs/核心组件/日志组件/日志组件-配置管理.md)
    2. Improved `Rotation` implementation to support log file splitting for short-running programs.
8. `gtag`
    1. Added `GetGlobalEnums` method to obtain globally registered enum types.
9. `gutil`
    1. Added `DumpJson` method to format and print any type of variable to the terminal in `JSON`, making it easier for human reading.
10. `gvalid`
    1. Added `enums` validation rule for automatic recognition and validation of enum types: [Data Validation - Rules](../docs/核心组件/数据校验/数据校验-校验规则.md)

## Community Components

1. Fixed load balancing issue of `contrib/registry/polaris` component when there are multiple servers.
2. Improved `contrib/drivers/pgsql` to have the `Index` field in `TableFields` return start uniformly from `0`.
3. Improved `contrib/nosql/redis` with added user configuration support.
4. Improved `contrib/rpc/grpcx` component, with the addition of `Endpoints` configuration support for `grpcx.Server`, enabling customizable service registration discovery addresses.
5. Added `contrib/sdk/httpclient` component, dependent library for `HTTP SDK` code files generated by the newly added `gf gen ctrl` command in this version.
6. Added `contrib/trace/otlpgrpc` and `contrib/trace/otlphttp` components for unified connection of tracing based on `OpenTelemetry`.

## Development Tools

1. Added `gf gen ctrl` command for compiling `api` definition directories, automatically generating standardized `controller`, `HTTP SDK` code: [Controller Generating](../docs/开发工具/代码生成-gen/接口规范-gen%20ctrl.md)
2. Improved `gf gen dao` command, added `TypeMapping` feature, allowing developers to customize the mapping of data table field types and generated `Go` entity data structure property types, and conveniently introduce third-party package types (such as `decimal` package for high-precision types): [Dao/Do/Entity Generating](../docs/开发工具/代码生成-gen/数据规范-gen%20dao.md)
3. Improved `gf gen enums` command, changed `Prefix` parameter to `Prefixes` to support specifying prefixes for multiple generated enum type packages: [Enums Maintenance](../docs/开发工具/代码生成-gen/枚举维护-gen%20enums.md)
4. Improved `gf gen service` command:
    - Added method comment generation in the generated `service` file.
    - When there is an `import` conflict in the generated `service` file, automatically generate `import alias`.
5. Improved command-line packaging, exposing `gfcmd.Command` type for developers to extend custom command-line functions.
6. Improved `gf docker` command, setting build file parameters as non-mandatory (for compatibility), which will be used only for `Docker` builds in the future without coupling binary build functions. For full build requirements, it is recommended to use it with `gf build`. Updated `make image` command in the project template, using `gf build+gf docker` commands.
7. Improved `gf init` command, fixed issues in some scenarios where initializing projects covered existing `.git/.gitignore` directories and files or permission errors.
8. Improved `gf up` command, fixed issues with framework version updates in certain scenarios, and installation problems under the `windows` system.
9. Improved `gf version` command, fixed issues with framework version recognition in some scenarios.
10. Fixed `gf gen pbentity` command, modifying the `float32/float64/[]byte` types in the generated `proto` file entity data structure to `float/double/bytes` types.
11. Improved development tools, some commands do not need to explicitly configure `importPrefix` parameter, such as: `gf gen dao/service`

## Compatibility Notice

1. In `ghttp.Request`, the `Context` and the `context.Context` returned by `GetCtx` method have removed the nesting of `NeverDoneCtx`, meaning the `ctx` context object passed by default in the controller fully inherits from the `ctx` in the standard library's `http.Request`. The `Done` method will be automatically called to terminate it at the end of a request, and this `ctx` cannot be propagated to async processes that need further execution. Therefore, starting with this version, users might encounter the following two issues:
   - To propagate to **async processes or maintain compatibility with previous logic**: Add a middleware that calls `r.SetCtx(r.GetNeverDoneCtx())` to globally override the subsequent `ctx` usage with a never-ending `ctx`.

![](/markdown/f9b3d06ba28250f95ac7c5c87df1d680.png)

- When the client actively cancels the request, the server might encounter a `context canceled` error. This is normal, and when the client no longer needs the request result, it will cancel the request, continuing to execute on the server-side makes no sense. If you mind this error, you can refer to the middleware above to add `NeverDoneCtx`, and the server will ignore the client's cancel and continue to execute.
