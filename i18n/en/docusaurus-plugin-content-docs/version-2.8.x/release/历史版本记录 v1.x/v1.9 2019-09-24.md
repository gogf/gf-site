description: "GoFrame framework released v1.9 version, including important new features and improvements. Added gf command line tool, gres resource manager, and gsession module, and enabled a more convenient WebServer routing registration method. Improved ghttp and gdb modules, adjusted container classification modules, and fixed some known issues."

This version is actually the major release of `v2.0`. To avoid the strict requirement of `go module` mechanism for `v2` and above versions needing to modify `import` and add `v2` suffix, it was released using `v1.9`.

### New Features

1. Added `gf` command line development assistant tool: [https://goframe.org/toolchain/cli](https://wiki.goframe.org/toolchain/cli)
2. Added `gres` resource manager module: [https://goframe.org/os/gres/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/os/gres/index)
3. Refactored `Session` functionality, added `gsession` module, and `WebServer` defaults to file storage `Session`: [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/session](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/session)
4. `WebServer` added middleware feature, retaining the original HOOK design, both can achieve request interception, pre-processing, etc.: [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/router/middleware](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/router/middleware)
5. Added `gi18n` localization management module: [https://goframe.org/i18n/gi18n/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/i18n/gi18n/index)
6. Added `gini` module: [https://goframe.org/encoding/gini/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/encoding/gini/index)
7. `WebServer` added more convenient hierarchical routing registration method: [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/group/level](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/group/level)
8. `gcmd` command line parameter parsing module refactored, added `Parser` parsing object: [https://goframe.org/os/gcmd/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/os/gcmd/index)
9. Added `gdebug` module for stack information retrieval/printing: [https://goframe.org/debug/gdebug/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/debug/gdebug/index)

### Major Adjustments

1. Removed methods marked as `deprecated` in `1.x` versions;
2. Adjusted container classification modules to default to non-concurrent safety;
3. Directory adjustments:
   - Removed `third` directory, unified management of package dependencies with `go module`;
   - Moved original modules in `g` directory to framework main directory, original `g` module moved to `frame/g` directory;
   - Changed original `geg` sample code directory name to `.example`;
