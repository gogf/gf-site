`Hello`, everyone! You've been waiting! It's been just six months since the last release, and many things have happened in this half-year. Schrödinger's cat determines different outcomes for the kitten by different means of observation, and similarly, the way we view the world shapes how the world appears to us. This time we bring you the latest `GoFrame v1.16` version! `GoFrame` is a modular, high-performance, enterprise-grade `Go` foundational development framework: [https://goframe.org](https://wiki.goframe.org), a low-key, pragmatic enterprise-grade `Golang` development framework in the true sense! This update includes numerous new features and enhancements, especially full tracing, `ORM` model association/nested transactions/subqueries/dozens of new methods, `HTTP` client interceptor, data validation and `I18N` enhancements, refactored timer, and more. There are a lot of updates this time, below are the major updates, hope you like them! `Enjoy!`

6. The framework's core foundational components have added a full error stack feature, allowing complete retrieval of error stack information for related components in the event of an error. This feature is only available in a well-designed, comprehensive foundational component framework.

## Functionality Improvements

1. `ORM`
   1. Added full tracing context `Context` parameter passing: [ORM - Context](../../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM上下文变量.md) During tracing, it will record `SQL` and database connection information (excluding sensitive configurations), and the component tracing information can be configured to be turned off.
   2. Further improved the `ORM` component logging, which is only valid in debug mode. For detailed introduction, refer to the section: [ORM - Senior Features](../../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM高级特性/ORM高级特性.md)
   3. Added dozens of `ORM` model operation methods referencing `PHP Laravel`, such as `InsertAndGetId`, `Min/Max/Avg/Sum`, `Increment/Decrement`, `WhereBetween/WhereLike/WhereIn/WhereNull`, `OrderAsc/OrderDesc/OrderRandom`, etc. It is highly recommended for those using `goframe` to take a look, for details, refer to the section:
      1. [ORM - Model 🔥](../../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM链式操作/ORM链式操作.md)
      2. [ORM Model - Insert/Save](../../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM链式操作/ORM链式操作-写入保存.md)
      3. [ORM Model - Update/Delete](../../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM链式操作/ORM链式操作-更新删除.md)
      4. [ORM Model - Query](../../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM链式操作/ORM链式操作-数据查询/ORM链式操作-数据查询.md)
   4. In the new version, the database `ORM` chain operation has enabled field filtering by default. Parameters that cannot be intelligently matched with table fields will be automatically filtered. For details, refer to the section: [ORM Model - Fields Filtering](../../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM链式操作/ORM链式操作-字段过滤.md)
   5. Improved the conversion of `pgsql` database type `int8` to `Golang` type, from `int` type adjusted to `int64`.
   6. Extensive refactoring and improvement work have been done, too detailed to describe each. The key result is richer component functionality, more rigorous code, simpler design, and easier use.
2. `HTTP`
   1. `HTTP Client` adds middleware interceptor functionality: [HTTPClient - Middleware](../../docs/WEB服务开发/HTTPClient/HTTPClient-拦截器中间件.md)

## Development Toolchain

`CLI` tools have been updated, mainly simplifying `dao` model code generation, eliminating redundant method generation, and removing methods that directly return model objects. The `dao` object is modified to directly inherit the `GoFrame ORM` component's `Model` object, accepting query data through the specified model, hence the ways of using some methods may require adjustments.
