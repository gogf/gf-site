Hello everyone! From late autumn to deep winter, we haven't been idle since the last release. We've brought you a heartwarming `GoFrame v1.15` version this time. In addition, there are two other things:

- `GoFrame` was selected by `OSC` Open Source China as one of the `TOP30` open source projects of `2020`: [https://www.oschina.net/question/2918182_2320114](https://www.oschina.net/question/2918182_2320114). Thank you for your recognition and support! Meanwhile, `GoFrame` is also a `Gitee GVP` [Most Valuable Project](https://gitee.com/johng/gf).
- The official website of `GoFrame` has been redesigned. You only need to experience it for a few minutes, and you'll be like me, loving this framework: [https://goframe.org](https://wiki.goframe.org). Thanks to [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) for the sponsorship, providing full product line license codes!

After years of dedicated development and stable growth, `GoFrame` has gradually grown into an enterprise-level `Golang` basic development framework, offering project development standards, development toolchains, complete basic modules, rich development documentation, high code quality, and an active community. To ensure the quality of the framework, we've conducted extensive unit testing across components to ensure logical correctness (`2534` test units, `9097` test assertions), while maintaining high-quality documentation. To date, many large, medium, and small internet companies have used `GoFrame` in production environments.

Open source is not easy, and with your understanding and support, happiness is abundant! Thank you to all the partners involved in the project development, love you all! `GoFrame, YES!`

## `GoFrame`

`GF(Go Frame)` is a modular, high-performance, enterprise-level `Go` basic development framework. It provides a complete infrastructure and development toolchain, offering commonly used basic development modules such as caching, logging, queues, arrays, sets, containers, timers, command lines, memory locks, configuration management, resource management, data validation, scheduled tasks, database `ORM`, `TCP/UDP` components, process management/communication, etc. It also provides a series of core components for `Web` service development, such as `Router`, `Cookie`, `Session`, `Middleware`, service registration, template engine, and supports hot restart, hot update, domain binding, `TLS/HTTPS`, `Rewrite`, and other features.

> If you are new to the `Go` language, you can compare `GoFrame` to `Laravel` in `PHP`, `SpringBoot` in `Java`, or `Django` in `Python`.

   - Some detail improvements.
   - Enhanced unit tests.

8. `internal`
   - Improved and refined `internal/empty` package's null value judgment.
   - Due to performance issues [https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/1004](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/1004), temporarily removed the dependency of the `internal/json` package on the third-party package [github.com/json-iterator/go](http://github.com/json-iterator/go), reverting to using the standard library `encoding/json`.
   - Improved `internal/structs` package by removing the dependency on the third-party package [github.com/gqcn/structs](http://github.com/gqcn/structs), simplifying the reflection processing logic, improving performance and usability, and enhancing long-term maintainability.
   - Added `RemoveSymbols` method in the `internal/utils` package for removing special characters in a string. Improved `EqualFoldWithoutChars` method by removing regex filtering of substrings, greatly enhancing method performance. These small functions contribute to improving the performance of other complex type conversion modules in the framework. Although the `internal` package does not expose methods directly, it impacts the performance of some core components within the framework.
