### New Features

1. The main repository has migrated from `gitee` to `github` ( [https://github.com/gogf/gf](https://github.com/gogf/gf) ), with `gitee` serving as a mirror site for domestic code contributions and ISSUE submissions. Migration details are available at: [https://goframe.org/upgradeto150](https://wiki.goframe.org/upgradeto150)
2. Significant improvements/enhancements have been made to the commonly used `container` array module: `garray`, including the addition of many commonly used methods, improved unit test cases, and method annotations. See API documentation: [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/container/garray](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/container/garray)
3. Significant improvements/enhancements have been made to the commonly used `container` set module: `gset`, including the addition of many commonly used methods, improved unit test cases, and method annotations. See API documentation: [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/container/gset](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/container/gset)
4. Significant improvements/enhancements have been made to the commonly used `container` MAP module: `gmap`, including the addition of many commonly used methods, improved unit test cases, and method annotations. See API documentation: [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/container/gmap](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/container/gmap)
5. Significant improvements/enhancements have been made to the commonly used string module: `gstr`, including the addition of many commonly used methods, improved unit test cases, and method annotations. See API documentation: [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/text/gstr](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/text/gstr)
6. Improved support for `struct`/ `*struct` parameters in `gform`, adjusting parameters of `*Insert/*Save/*Replace/*Update/Where/Data` methods to `interface{}` type, supporting parameter passing of any type: `string/map/slice/struct/*struct`. Refer to: [https://goframe.org/database/orm/chaining](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/orm/chaining)
7. Added/improved test cases for several modules, including: `gvalid`/ `gregex`/ `garray`/ `gset`/ `gmap`/ `gstr`/ `gconv`/ `ghttp`/ `gdb`;
8. As the `gkafka` module is relatively heavy and not a core module of the framework, it has been moved to a new repository for independent management, and the related dependency package has been removed: [https://github.com/gogf/gkafka](https://github.com/gogf/gkafka)
9. Added `greuseport` module to implement TCP `REUSEPORT` feature: [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/greuseport](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/greuseport)

### New Features/Improvements

1. Removed memory overhead caused by automatic initialization of `session` object in template engine's built-in variables;
2. Improved `ghttp.Client`, adding several methods. See: [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/client](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/client)
3. Added `COMMON` method to `ghttp` group routing for registering commonly used `HTTP METHOD` (`GET/PUT/POST/DELETE`) routes;
4. Updated framework dependencies for the `golang.org/x/sys` module;
5. Improved `gform` batch operation return result object, allowing accurate retrieval of affected record rows through the result object;
6. Moved `gstr`/ `gregex` modules from `util` category to `text` category directory;
7. Moved `gtest` module from `util` category to `test` category directory;
8. Improved `glog` method annotations;

### Bug Fixes

1. Fixed issue where emails with dots were not successfully matched using `gvalid.Check` with the " `email`" rule;
2. Fixed failure issue with `gvalid.Check` under `regex` rule;
3. Fixed issue in the `gcron` module timing rules where days and weeks did not allow `?` symbol;
4. Fixed issue where `ghttp.Server` returned `200` status code in some exceptional cases;
5. Fixed "memory leak" issue caused by atomic operations in the `gfpool` module under high concurrency;
6. Fixed issue where the method `Index` routing could only be accessed through `/xxx/index` when registering group route/controls;
7. Fixed error issue when using the template engine without a `config.toml` (even if not used) configuration file;
8. Other fixes;
