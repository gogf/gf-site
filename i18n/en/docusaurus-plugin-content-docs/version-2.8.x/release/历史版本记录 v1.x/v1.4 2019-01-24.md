description: "This GoFrame framework v1.4 release brings several new features and improvements. A new high-performance task timer module gtimer has been added, along with a refactor and optimization of the gcron module. The gconv module now supports conversion of struct pointer properties, and gform has added automatic recognition of database types. Additionally, multiple modules have been improved for performance and concurrency safety, and some known issues have been fixed."

### New Features

1. Added a concurrency-safe high-performance task timer module `gtimer`, similar to Java's `Timer`, but more powerful. It is implemented with a flexible and efficient hierarchical timing wheel design and can manage millions of scheduled tasks. `gtimer` is one of the core modules of the `GoFrame` framework, with unit test coverage of `93.6%`: [https://goframe.org/os/gtimer/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/os/gtimer/index)
2. Refactored the `gcron` scheduled task module using the task timer `gtimer`, removing reliance on the third-party package `github.com/robfig/cron`. `gcron` now supports singleton pattern scheduled tasks: [https://goframe.org/os/gcron/index#](https://wiki.goframe.org/os/gcron/index);
3. The `gconv` type conversion module now supports conversion of **pointer properties** within `struct` structures: [https://goframe.org/util/gconv/struct](https://wiki.goframe.org/util/gconv/struct);
4. `gform` has added a feature to automatically recognize database types, which is very useful when the query results need to be returned in `json` format: [https://goframe.org/database/orm/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/orm/index)
5. `Travis CI` has added support for automated testing on the `386` architecture (currently supports both `386` and `amd64`);

### New Functions

1. The `ghttp` module adds `Exit`, `ExitAll`, and `ExitHook` methods for HTTP request flow control: [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/service/object](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/service/object);
2. The `grand` module adds `Meet/MeetProb` methods for random probability-based judgments and adds alias methods `N/Str/Digits/Letters`;
3. The `gvalid` data/form validation module adds support for validating `16X` and `19X` phone numbers;

### Function Improvements

1. `gform` sets the default database connection pool `CONN_MAX_LIFE` parameter value to `30` seconds;
2. Improved the `glist` module, boosting performance by about `20%` and adding several linked list operation methods;
3. Enhanced the `gqueue` module, increasing performance by about `50%` and adding support for `select` syntax with the use of `Queue.C`: [https://goframe.org/container/gqueue/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/container/gqueue/index);
4. Improved the `gmlock` memory lock module and completed unit test cases: [https://goframe.org/os/gmlock/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/os/gmlock/index);
5. Improved all concurrency-safe container modules, changing the non-required parameter `safe...bool` to `unsafe...bool` for concurrency safety control;
6. Enhanced the `gpool` object reuse module to support concurrency safety;
7. Updated third-party dependencies for the `gkafka` module;
8. Completed unit test cases for the `ghttp` module;

### Bug Fix

1. Fixed the issue where the file pointer was not closed when operating on files in the `gmd5` module;
2. Fixed the issue where expired cache items were not deleted in the `gcache` module;
3. Other fixes;
