## Change Log

Since `GoFrame` is designed modularly, the update log for each version is introduced in the form of modules.

Important updates:

1. Replaced all `json` operations within the framework from the standard library to `json-iterator/go`, improving operational efficiency.
2. Refactored the underlying design of the cache module, adding adapter design patterns, and adding memory and `Redis` adapter support. The memory adapter is provided by the default core module, while the `Redis` adapter is provided by the community module: [https://goframe.org/os/gcache/adapter](https://wiki.goframe.org/os/gcache/adapter)
3. Added customizable validation rule registration feature: [https://goframe.org/util/gvalid/customrule](https://wiki.goframe.org/util/gvalid/customrule)
4. `Web Server` added examples for all configuration items: [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/config/example](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/config/example)
5. `ORM` added `SQL` cache adapter based on `Redis`: [https://goframe.org/database/gdb/model/cache](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/gdb/model/cache)
6. `ORM` added experimental feature for model associations: [https://goframe.org/database/gdb/model/association](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/gdb/model/association)
7. Improved automatic update feature of time in `ORM`, adding customizable time fields: [https://goframe.org/database/gdb/model/auto-time](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/gdb/model/auto-time)
8. Error handling module added `Current` and `Next` methods: [https://goframe.org/errors/gerror/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/errors/gerror/index)

### `net`

1. `ghttp`
   - `Client`
     - Added `GetVar/PutVar/PostVar` requests methods, which allow sending `HTTP` requests and directly returning generic objects for convenient type conversion, making handling of returned `XML/JSON` results simpler: [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/client/demo/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/client/demo/index)
     - Added `SetProxy/Proxy` methods to set client proxy, supporting `HTTP/Socket5` proxy types: [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/client/demo/proxy](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/client/demo/proxy)
     - Added `SetRedirectLimit/RedirectLimit` methods to set page redirect limit.
   - `Request`
     - Added `ParseQuery`, `ParseForm` methods to parse specified parameter types and bind them to a given object.
     - Added `GetHeader` method to get specified `Header` parameters.
     - Added `GetRemoteIp` method to get the IP of the requesting client. When using IP whitelist restrictions, use `GetRemoteIp` instead of `GetClientIp`, as the latter can be forged through `Header`.
     - Added `ReloadParam` method, often used in middleware processing when middleware modifies request parameters and calls this method to reparse them.
     - Added `GetRouterMap` method to get all routing parameters returned as a `map`.
   - `Response`
     - Renamed `Output` method to `Flush`, used for writing buffer data to the client stream.
   - `Server`
     - `Server` added examples for all configuration items: [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/config/example](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/config/example)
     - Added `SessionCookieOutput` configuration to control whether to output `SessionId` to `Cookie`, enabled by default.
     - Improved route parsing to support `URI` with repeated `/` symbols.
     - `Pprof` function routes support `Domain` binding.
     - Other minor improvements.
   - `Cookie`
     - Added `SetHttpCookie` method to set `Cookie` based on a standard library `http.Cookie` object.
     - Other functional improvements.

   - Added `Result.MapKeyValue` method to convert the current `Result` to `map[string]Value` type.
   - Added `Result.IsEmpty/Len/Size/ScanList` methods.
   - Added `ListItemValues` and `ListItemValuesUnique` methods to automatically get the values or properties with specified names in the `list`, returning them as a `slice`.
   - `SQL` log content includes group name printing.
   - Improved `DataToMapDeep` method.
   - Other minor improvements.
2. `gredis`

   - Added `TLS` feature support and configuration file support, [https://goframe.org/database/gredis/config](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/gredis/config)

### `container`

1. `gvar`
   - Added `Scan` and `ScanDeep` methods for automatic recognition and conversion of `struct`/`slice`.
   - Added `ListItemValues` and `ListItemValuesUnique` methods to automatically get the values or properties with specified names in the `list`, returning them as a `slice`.
   - Added `MapStrAny` interface implementation method.

### `os`

1. `gcache`

   - Added `GetVar` method to get cached data and return it as a generic object.
   - Added `Update` method to only modify cache values without modifying expiration times.
   - Added `UpdateExpire` method to only modify cache expiration times without modifying values.
   - Refactored underlying design, adding adapter design patterns, and memory and `Redis` adapter support. The memory adapter is provided by the default core module, and the `Redis` adapter is provided by the community module: [https://goframe.org/os/gcache/adapter](https://wiki.goframe.org/os/gcache/adapter)
   - Note, this module modification may have some method incompatibility, some methods added `error` parameter return, please review carefully when upgrading. Compilation will not pass.

   - Added `AddWithRecover` method for adding asynchronous tasks with a given `recover` handling method, processing `panic` in tasks to prevent the entire process crash.
   - Solves the issue that `recover` can only capture `panic` in the current `goroutine`, therefore a specific `recover` handling method can only be specified when creating asynchronous tasks.
5. `gtime`

   - Added `ParseDuration` method with support for time unit `d` representing days.
   - Improved `` method with support to create `gtime.Time` objects from strings, timestamps, `time.Time` objects, [https://goframe.org/os/gtime/time](https://wiki.goframe.org/os/gtime/time)
   - Improved `Add/AddStr/ToLocation/ToZone/UTCLocal/AddDate/Truncate/Round` methods, these methods now create and return new `gtime.Time` objects without altering the current object itself to ensure consistency with the standard library `time.Time` logic and avoid confusion.
   - Other minor improvements.
6. `gtimer`

   - Added `Reset` method for resetting timer task counts.
7. `gfcache`

   - Removed the module, as its functionality was not particularly significant.

### `text`

1. `gstr`
   - Added `SnakeFirstUpperCase` method, which adds connectors before uppercase letters and does not process numbers, e.g., `SnakeFirstUpperCase("RGBCodeMd5")` will return `rgb_code_md5`.

### `util`

1. `gconv`

   - Added support for basic pointer type conversion.
   - Added `Scan/ScanDeep` methods for automatic recognition and conversion of `Struct/[]Struct`.
   - Improved recursive layer handling in `MapDeep` method.
   - Other minor and performance improvements.
2. `gutil`
