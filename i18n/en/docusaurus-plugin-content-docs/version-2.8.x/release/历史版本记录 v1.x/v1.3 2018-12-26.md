### New Features

1. Completed the refactoring of `gform` to improve scalability, and fixed some detail issues, and improved unit test cases ( [https://goframe.org/database/orm/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/orm/index));
2. Added group routing feature for `WebServer` route registration ( [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/group](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/group));
3. Added `Rewrite` routing feature to `WebServer` ( [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/static](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/static));
4. Added automatic recognition of the development environment at runtime;
5. Added `Travis CI` for automated building/testing;

### New Functions

1. Improved `WebServer` static file service functionality, added `SetStaticPath`/`AddStaticPath` methods ( [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/static](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/static));
2. Added `Filter` chaining method to `gform` for filtering non-table field key-value pairs in parameters ( [https://goframe.org/database/orm/linkop](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/orm/linkop));
3. Added `Data` method to `gcache` for obtaining all cache data items;
4. Added `GetConn` method to `gredis` for obtaining native Redis connection objects;

### Function Improvements

1. Improved the `Where` method of `gform` to support `slice` type parameters and more conveniently support `in` operation queries ( [https://goframe.org/database/orm/linkop](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/orm/linkop));
2. Improved `gproc` inter-process communication data structure, expanded `pid` field from `16bit` to `24bit`;
3. Improved `gconv`/`gmap`/`garray`, added several operation methods;
4. Improved the `date` built-in function in the `gview` template engine, printing the current system time when the given timestamp is empty;
5. Improved the `gview` template engine to display empty when the printed variable does not exist (default standard library shows `<no value>`);
6. Improved `WebServer` by removing `HANGUP` signal monitoring to avoid abnormal exit issues when running through `nohup`;
7. Enhanced `gcache` performance and improved benchmark tests;

### Bug Fixes

1. Fixed cache resource contention issue when `gcache` is closed with non-LRU features, and fixed return value issue of `doSetWithLockCheck` internal method;
2. Fixed random number bit overflow issue in `grand.intn` internal method on the `x86` architecture;
3. Fixed byte length overflow issue caused by automatic matching of `Int` method in `gbinary` targeting `[]byte` parameter length;
4. Fixed Go variable encoding issue in `gjson` due to official standard library `json` not supporting `map[interface{}]*` types;
5. Fixed data race issue in some methods of `garray`, and fixed binary search sorting issue;
6. Fixed parameter retrieval issue in `ghttp.Request.GetVar` method;
7. Resolved `gform` database connection pool not working problem;
