## GoFrame

`GF(Go Frame)` is a modular, high-performance, production-grade Go foundational development framework. It provides comprehensive infrastructure and development toolchain, offering commonly used development modules such as caching, logging, queue, array, collection, container, timer, command line, memory lock, object pool, configuration management, resource management, data validation, data encoding, cron jobs, database ORM, TCP/UDP components, process management/communication, etc. Moreover, it includes core components for web service development, such as Router, Cookie, Session, Middleware, service registration, template engine, and it supports hot restart, hot update, domain binding, TLS/HTTPS, Rewrite, etc.

### Features

- Rich modules, ready to use;
- Easy to use, easy to maintain;
- High code quality, high unit test coverage;
- Active community with humble and amiable experts;
- Comprehensive documentation and examples;
- Complete localization support in Chinese;
- Designed for team and enterprise use;

### Development

`GoFrame` originated in Beijing in 2011, from a smart IoT platform project before many current IoT standards existed, and when Go’s standard library and ecosystem were not as rich. It wasn't until 2017 that `GoFrame` released its test version, and in 2018, during the 1024 programmer’s festival, it released the official `v1.0` version, contributing to the Go ecosystem's development. Since its open-source launch, it has iterated quickly, growing widely favored by developers and enterprises, with many developers contributing. Originally designed for development teams, its development efficiency and maintainability are excellent, with high code quality and abundant unit tests and examples. `GoFrame` is currently the best Go development framework with localized Chinese documentation.

## Change Log
