Hello everyone! Thank you for waiting!

Since the last version release, more and more friends have joined the `GoFrame` family and provided many valuable suggestions and feedback. This version addresses most of these feedbacks, including most of the improvement suggestions and some new features, which is why this release took more than two months. `GoFrame` is very focused on code quality and sustainable maintainability. This version further refines the examples, comments, and unit test cases for most modules in the framework. Currently, there are about `1991` unit test cases with a code coverage of `71%`, covering most of the main functions of all modules.

The `GoFrame` framework provides common, high-quality basic development modules, lightweight, modular, and high-performance. We recommend reading the framework source code to learn more details. This release has a few incompatible upgrades, often requiring batch replacements. The following `change log` is quite comprehensive, and it is recommended to read it carefully before upgrading.

This release marks the start of the next version development plan, and more friends are welcome to participate in open source contributions: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/projects/8](https://github.com/gogf/gf/projects/8)

Thank you for your support! Enjoy your `GoFrame`!

## Change Log

From `GoFrame v1.12` version, the minimum `Golang` runtime version required by the framework is `v1.13`. Since new versions of `Golang` are backward compatible, it is recommended to update to use the new version of `Golang`: [https://golang.google.cn/dl/](https://golang.google.cn/dl/)

> This version also introduces support for the `Swagger` tools and plugins, released separately.

### `tool chain`

1. The `gen model` command adds model generation support for `pgsql/mssql/sqlite/oracle`.
2. The `gen model` command generates a public package variable `Columns` for retrieving table field names.

### `net`

1. `ghttp`
   - Note: Starting from this version, the `Server` has the graceful restart feature disabled by default. Developers can enable it through the appropriate configuration options.
   - Improved `Client.Get` method with optional request parameters.
   - Added chainable methods for `Client`: `Header`, `HeaderRaw`, `Cookie`, `ContentType`, `ContentJson`, `ContentXml`, `Timeout`, `BasicAuth`, `Ctx`: [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/client/chain](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/client/chain)
   - Added context variable management methods `Request.GetCtx/GetCtxVar/SetCtxVar/Context` for internal request context variables:
     - Custom Variables: [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/request/custom](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/request/custom)
     - Context Variables: [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/request/context](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/request/context)
   - Added `Request.GetUploadFile/GetUploadFiles` methods and `UploadFile` type, greatly simplifying file upload processing logic: [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/client/demo/upload](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/client/demo/upload)
   - Added `Request.GetPage` method for convenient pagination object retrieval:
     - Introduction: [https://goframe.org/util/gpage/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/util/gpage/index)
     - Dynamic Pagination: [https://goframe.org/util/gpage/dynamic](https://wiki.goframe.org/util/gpage/dynamic)
     - Static Pagination: [https://goframe.org/util/gpage/static](https://wiki.goframe.org/util/gpage/static)
     - Ajax Pagination: [https://goframe.org/util/gpage/ajax](https://wiki.goframe.org/util/gpage/ajax)
     - URL Templates: [https://goframe.org/util/gpage/template](https://wiki.goframe.org/util/gpage/template)
     - Custom Pagination: [https://goframe.org/util/gpage/custom](https://wiki.goframe.org/util/gpage/custom)
   - Improved `Response.Redirect*` method with a customizable HTTP status code parameter for redirection.
   - Enhanced `CORS` feature, improved cross-origin handling, fully conforming to `W3C` specifications regarding the `OPTIONS` request method: [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/cors](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/cors)
   - Added `Request` built-in variable to template view objects, allowing templates to obtain request parameters. As the `GoFrame` framework's template engine uses a two-level cache design, it reduces `IO` overhead while improving execution efficiency. Even with a large number of built-in variables and methods added, extensive performance tests have shown that efficiency is 50% to 200% higher than other `WebServer` libraries under the same logic.
   - Introduced an experimental `Plugin` feature for `Server`.
   - Improved the underlying route storage and retrieval logic of `Server`, optimized code, and enhanced efficiency.
   - Enhanced source location tracking for group route registration, allowing for precise location and prompt of duplicate route source locations when there are registration conflicts.
   - Improved `Server` log handling.
   - Enhanced unit testing.

### `database`

1. `gdb`

   - Code refactoring and improvements, introducing `Driver` interface design for custom driver implementations by developers. Added `Register` package method to allow developers to register custom database type drivers: [https://goframe.org/database/gdb/driver](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/gdb/driver)
   - Added `GetArray` interface and implementation for retrieving data for specified field columns, returning an array: [https://goframe.org/database/gdb/model/select](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/gdb/model/select)
   - Added `InsertIgnore` interface and implementation for ignoring write conflicts during write operations, applicable only to `mysql` database type: [https://goframe.org/database/gdb/model/insert-save](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/gdb/model/insert-save)
   - Added `Schema` interface and implementation for dynamically switching and getting database objects with specified names: [https://goframe.org/database/gdb/model/schema](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/gdb/model/schema)

     - [https://goframe.org/database/gdb/model/select](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/gdb/model/select)
     - [https://goframe.org/database/gdb/model/update-delete](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/gdb/model/update-delete)
   - Added `Array` method to query result object `Result` for obtaining values of specified fields, returning them in an array: [https://goframe.org/database/gdb/result](https://wiki.goframe.org/database/gdb/result)
   - Improved `OmitEmpty` method for filtering `Data` input parameters. If the given `Data` parameter is an empty time object, it will be filtered out.
   - Added default database connection pool parameter: `MaxIdleConns=10`.
   - Various other improvements.
   - Enhanced unit testing.
2. `gredis`

   - Increased/modified default database connection pool parameters: `MaxIdle=10`, `IdleTimeout=10s`, `MaxConnLifetime=30s`, `Wait=true`.
   - Enhanced unit testing.

### `container`

1. Added `UnmarshalValue(interface{}) error` interface method implementation to all container objects, used by `gconv` for creating/setting object content based on arbitrary type variables. All container objects in the `GoFrame` framework have implemented this interface.

2. `garray`

   - Added `RemoveValue` method for searching and removing elements based on values.
   - Added `FilterNil` method for traversing and removing `nil` elements from an array.
   - Added `FilterEmpty` method for traversing and removing empty value elements from an array. Empty values include: `0, nil, false, "", len(slice/map/chan) == 0`.
   - Improved `Set/Fill/InsertBefore/InsertAfter` methods with stricter validation, changing the original chain operation return value object to `error` return value.
   - Enhanced `Get/Remove/PopRand/PopLeft/PopRight/Rand` methods with stricter validation, adding a `found` boolean return value to indicate if the method has data to return. If the array is empty or the operation is out of range, `found` returns `false`.
   - Changed `Rands` method logic to ensure it returns a random array of the specified size.
   - Enhanced unit testing.
3. `gpool`

   - Adjusted the expiration time parameter type of the cache pool. The old version used `int` type representing milliseconds, while the new version uses `time.Duration` type making time control more flexible.
   - Internal code optimization and performance improvement.
   - Enhanced unit testing.
   - Improved annotations.

### `os`

1. `glog`

    - Introduced `Rotation` log rolling feature, with options for log splitting based on file size or expiration time, supporting the limit of split file numbers, automatic compression of split files, customizable compression levels (`1-9`), and support for cleaning up expired split files: [https://goframe.org/os/glog/rotate](https://wiki.goframe.org/os/glog/rotate)
    - Added `LevelPrefixes` feature for customizing prefix names for log levels: [https://goframe.org/os/glog/level](https://wiki.goframe.org/os/glog/level)
    - Added `SetLevelStr` method and feature to configure log levels using strings:
      - [https://goframe.org/os/glog/level](https://wiki.goframe.org/os/glog/level)
      - [https://goframe.org/os/glog/config](https://wiki.goframe.org/os/glog/config)
    - Introduced `SetDefaultLogger` package method for setting the global default `Logger` object.
2. `gres`

    1. Improved resource content encoding design with a new compression algorithm, reducing resource file size, such as the original `15MB` website static resource files (`css/js/html`, etc.) reduced to approximately `4MB` after packaging: [https://goframe.org/os/gres/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/os/gres/index)
    2. Note: This improvement is not compatible with the old version and requires re-packing of existing resource files.
    3. Enhanced unit testing.
3. `gcfg`

    - Removed atomic concurrency safety control for configuration object attributes, changed to ordinary variable types. Since configuration management is one of the most used modules, high efficiency in design and method implementation is ensured.
    - Significant adjustment to singleton objects: To facilitate the use of configuration files in multi-file scenarios and improve development efficiency, when the `toml` configuration file corresponding to the given singleton name exists in the configuration directory, the default configuration file of the singleton object is automatically set to this file. For example, the singleton object obtained by `g.Cfg("redis")` will default to retrieving and setting the default configuration file as `redis.toml`. If the file does not exist, the default configuration file (`config.toml`) is used: [https://goframe.org/net/ghttp/config](https://wiki.goframe.org/net/ghttp/config)
    - Enhanced unit testing.
4. `gview`

    - Added `concat` built-in string concatenation method: [https://goframe.org/os/gview/function/buildin](https://wiki.goframe.org/os/gview/function/buildin)
    - Enhanced unit testing.
5. `gfile`

    - Improved `SelfPath` method for obtaining the current executable file path, increasing execution efficiency.
    - Enhanced `Join` method for connecting file paths, preventing redundant path connection symbols.
    - Improved execution efficiency of `GetContents` method, reducing memory usage.
    - Added `StrToSize` method for converting size strings to byte numbers. Size strings include `10m`, `5KB`, `1.25Gib`, etc.
    - Added `ReadLines/ReadByteLines` methods for reading specified file content line by line with a given read callback function.
    - Enhanced unit testing.
6. `gtime`

    - Improved the implementation of `gtime.Time` object, unified string printed time format to `Y-m-d H:i:s`, such as `2020-01-01 12:00:00`.
7. `gcmd`

    - Added `strict` parameter to command-line parsing methods for determining whether the current parsing is strict. In strict parsing, if illegal options are given, parsing stops and returns an error. By default, it is non-strict parsing.
8. `genv`

    - Improved `Remove` method for deleting environment variable key-value pairs, adding the ability to delete multiple key-value pair environment variables.
9. `gfpool`

    - Improved code implementation, increasing efficiency.
    - Enhanced unit testing.
10. `gfsnotify`

    - Improved package initialization method. If the default `Watcher` object fails to create due to system reasons, it `panic`s directly.
11. `gproc`

    - Improved `SearchBinaryPath` method.
    - Improved `Process.Kill` method for handling different behaviors on `windows` and `*niux` platforms.

### `frame`

1. `g`
   - Added `IsNil` method to determine if the given variable is `nil`, potentially using reflection for judgment.
   - Added `IsEmpty` method to determine if the given variable is `empty`. This method primarily uses assertion but may use reflection for judgment. Empty values include: `0, nil, false, "", len(slice/map/chan) == 0`.
   - Deprecated `SetServerGraceful` method, managed uniformly through `Server` configuration.
2. `gins`
   - Improved code structure for easier maintenance.
   - Enhanced and improved unit testing.

   - Enhanced `Map/Struct` conversion methods with additional detail handling for special scenarios. Continuous improvement based on extensive usage and feedback.
   - Updated `Struct` conversion method to support `UnmarshalValue(interface{}) error` interface.
   - Enhanced unit testing.
2. `grand`

   - Note: Incompatible adjustment, the original `Str` method renamed to `S` for obtaining a random string of specified length along with the `symbol` parameter, to specify whether special visible characters can be returned randomly.
   - Added `Str` method for randomly retrieving a string of specified length from specified string characters, supporting `unicode` strings, such as Chinese: [https://goframe.org/util/grand/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/util/grand/index)
   - Added `Symbols` method for randomly returning special visible characters for specified purposes: [https://goframe.org/util/grand/index](https://wiki.goframe.org/util/grand/index)
   - Enhanced unit testing.
3. `gvalid`

   - Length validation rules now support `unicode` strings, such as Chinese.

## Bug Fix

1. Fixed the view object configuration issue in `Server`.
2. Fixed the issue where middleware in `Server` ignored `Middleware.Next` method control in the event of `panic` in middleware, causing authentication middleware to fail.
3. Resolved the `gudp.Server` packet loss problem when request packet size exceeds `64bytes`, and the default buffer size has been adjusted to `1024bytes`. Developers can customize buffer size.
4. Corrected `gfile.MTimeMillisecond` method to return the correct file modification millisecond timestamp.
5. Fixed `gconv.Int64` conversion support for negative numbers.
6. Various other fixes.
