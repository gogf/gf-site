description: "New features, improvements, and bug fixes in version v0.3 of the GoFrame framework. New features include the addition of a DES encryption/decryption package, Golang client for Kafka, and an object reuse pool. Improvements cover the refactoring of network communication packages, database query caching features, HTTP client account password settings, and enhanced server routing matching rules. Additionally, various packages and functions have been optimized to improve system performance and stability."

### New Features

1. Added the gdes package for handling DES encryption/decryption algorithms;
2. Added the gkafka package, a Golang client for Kafka;
3. Added the gpool object reuse pool, which is more flexible and powerful than the standard library's sync.Pool, allowing customization of object caching time, creation methods, and destruction methods ([http://gf.johng.cn/686654)](http://gf.johng.cn/686654));
4. Completed the refactoring of gtcp/gudp network communication packages with substantial improvements and added detailed documentation and example code ([http://gf.johng.cn/494382)](http://gf.johng.cn/494382));
5. Added the gring concurrency-safe ring, a concurrency-safe version of the standard library container/ring package, with ease-of-use encapsulation ([http://gf.johng.cn/686655)](http://gf.johng.cn/686655));
6. The gtime package now supports custom date formatting, with formatting syntax similar to PHP's date syntax ([http://gf.johng.cn/494387)](http://gf.johng.cn/494387));
7. Added a debug mode feature to gdb, implemented via the SetDebug method, which allows detailed SQL execution records in debug mode, with detailed documentation and example code ([http://gf.johng.cn/702801)](http://gf.johng.cn/702801));
8. Added a query caching feature to gdb, implemented via the Cache method, with detailed documentation and example code ([http://gf.johng.cn/702801)](http://gf.johng.cn/702801));
9. The ghttp.Server routing feature now includes field matching rules, supporting dynamic routing rules like `/order/list/{page}.html` ([http://gf.johng.cn/702766)](http://gf.johng.cn/702766));
10. Added pagination URL rule generation templates to the gpage pagination package, allowing the use of the `{.page}` variable to specify the page number position ([http://gf.johng.cn/716438)](http://gf.johng.cn/716438));
11. Added the gmap.Map object, an alias for gmap.InterfaceInterfaceMap;

### New Features

1. gdb added MaxIdleConnCount/MaxOpenConnCount/MaxConnLifetime settings and the SetMaxConnLifetime method;
2. ghttp.Client added HTTP account password setting function (SetBasicAuth);
3. glog added adaptive adjustment for system newline characters (\\n\|\\r\\n);
4. Added glog console debug mode printing switch (SetDebug);
5. gcfg added the SetFileName method to set the default configuration file name;
6. gcfg/gjson/gparser packages added Int8/16/32/64, Uint8/16/32/64 methods;
7. Added encapsulation for gzip methods (Zip/Unzip);
8. gview added template variable delimiter setting method SetDelimiters;
9. ghttp.Response added Writef, Writefln methods;

### Improvements

1. Improved gfilepool file pointer pool design; improved gfile text content writing, with added pointer pool usage;
2. gdb package added debug mode feature, supporting executed SQL list results retrieval in debug mode;
3. Improved gproc inter-process communication mechanism, added process message grouping feature and limited queue size;
4. gdb result method processing added ToXml/ToJson methods;
5. Changed gregx package name to gregex;
6. Improved gtime.StrToTime method, added automatic conversion for common standard date-time formats, and automatic timezone recognition, with adjustments to gconv, gvalid referencing this package;
7. Added character set conversion encapsulation, with gxml package using the newly added character set conversion package for handling;
8. ghttp.Server.EnableAdmin page Restart interface supports GET parameter newExeFilePath;
9. ghttp.Server graceful restart mechanism added customizable restart executable file path, especially useful for Windows systems (as Windows does not support executable file overlay updates);
10. Improved ghttp.Server static file retrieval design, with a lookup mechanism in the main package source directory during development environments; improved gcfg/gview lookup mechanism in the main package source directory;
11. Optimized gcache design, with the LRU feature not enabled by default; optimized gtype/gcache benchmark scripts; added gregx benchmark scripts, improved design for enhanced performance;
12. gfile package added GoRootOfBuild method to retrieve the GOROOT value at compile time; improved backtrace GOROOT path filtering in the glog package;
13. Improved grpool code quality, and improved pool goroutine quantity limit design;
14. Improved gdb.Map/List and g.Map/List type definitions, using alias features to support native type inputs (map/slice), and fixed gdb.Model.Update method parameter handling issue;
15. Adjusted ghttp package example code directory structure, added ghttp.Client custom Header methods, ghttp.Cookie added Map method for retrieving all cookie values submitted by the client, returned as a map;
16. Removed getcharset method from gcharset;
17. Removed common basic data type conversion retrieval methods from gmap;
18. Improved gconv.String method, using json.Marshal for conversion if basic type string conversion is not possible;
19. gvalid.CheckObject method name changed to gvalid.CheckStruct;

### Bug Fixes

1. Fixed gstr.IsNumeric error;
2. Fixed error when XML encoding charset is non-UTF-8;
3. Fixed gconv package float32 to float64 precision issue;
4. Fixed gpage package pagination count issue;
5. Fixed gdb batch data Save error;
6. Removed usage of math.MAXINT64 constant in gpool to fix int64 to int type conversion error, compatible with 32-bit systems;
7. Fixed ghttp package initializing related asynchronous goroutines without using Server issue.
