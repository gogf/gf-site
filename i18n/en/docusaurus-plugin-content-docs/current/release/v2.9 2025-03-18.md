## Compatibility Notes
1. `net/client`
    - When the global service registration and discovery component is enabled, the `HTTP Client` objects created by this component no longer enable service discovery by default. Manual activation is required.

2. `os/glog`
    - The default time printing format for logs has been adjusted to the more rigorous `2006-01-02T15:04:05.000Z07:00`.

    - Fixed an issue where when users add a `Select Hook` and modify the return structure, it causes abnormal query results in `Count/Value/Array` in some scenarios.
    - Fixed an issue where the `orm` tag in the metadata tag of `embedded struct` in the data structure becomes ineffective when using the `with` feature.
    - Fixed an incompatibility issue with older versions where `tinyint(1)/int(1)` types are identified as `bool` type.
    - Fixed an incompatibility issue with older versions in the `Order("id", "desc")` statement in the `database/gdb` component.
    - Optimized `ORM` query performance and memory usage efficiency.

2. `net/ghttp`
    - Added common middleware `MiddlewareGzip` support for compressing return results using the `gzip` algorithm, improving transmission efficiency and performance.
    - Added `HandlerItemParsed.GetMetaTag` method, which can be used to get the interface definition metadata information through the `GetMetaTag` method after getting the current route execution method through `GetServeHandler`, enhancing route metadata management capabilities.
    - Removed the `*Req/*Res` naming rule restriction for input and output data structures when defining `api` in standard route registration, supporting more flexible naming methods.
    - Fixed an issue where the default value setting for interface parameters also takes effect when submitting empty parameters (empty string or `0`), causing inconsistency with the document description.
    - Fixed an issue where the logic of automatically generating `Origin` from `Referer` in cross-domain return `Header` is not rigorous, enhancing `CORS` security.
    - Fixed an issue where the `json omitempty` tag is ineffective when the `BuildParams` method builds request parameters.
    - Fixed a null pointer `panic` issue that would occur when `Logger` is set to `nil`, improving component stability.

    - Fixed an issue where the `embedded struct` data structure in parameter data structures cannot be expanded into parameter structures, improving complex data structure support.
    - Optimized document generation performance and memory usage.

2. `net/client`
    - When the global service registration and discovery component is enabled, the `HTTP Client` objects created by this component no longer enable service discovery by default and need to be manually enabled: [Service Registration and Discovery](../docs/微服务开发/服务注册发现.md)

4. `os/gcache`
    - Fixed an issue where the data type returned by the `Remove` method in the component is incompatible with older versions.
