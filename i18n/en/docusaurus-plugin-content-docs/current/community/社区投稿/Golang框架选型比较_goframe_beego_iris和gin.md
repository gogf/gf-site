Solve problems? Bring problems?

Due to work requirements, I have encountered many development frameworks over the years. While there are numerous Golang development frameworks, they are primarily Web "frameworks". The quotation marks are used here because most "frameworks", from their design and functional positioning, can at best be considered as components. When projects need to use them, developers often have to search for other components elsewhere or build their own. For Web development, these "frameworks" all have complete Web development capabilities with little difference, and they are all secondary encapsulations of the standard library net/http.Server. Due to the large number of frameworks available, I have selected only a few that I have previously evaluated for technical selection, am familiar with, and are currently popular and typical Golang "frameworks". I will make a simple horizontal comparison from the perspective of business project development frameworks, to provide a reference for everyone when selecting a project framework."

Experience Sharing
====

Different scenarios require different choices. Choose the right tool to solve the right problem.

In open source, there's no absolute better or worse. Open source authors sharing their technical achievements in the spirit of open source for learning and use is itself a commendable and valuable contribution.

Finally, I'd like to share my team's experience and the challenges we faced during our transition to the `Golang` technology stack, hoping it can provide some reference for others in their framework selection process.

Initial Pain Points
------

Here's some background on our team's transition to the `Golang` technology stack. The main points are:

1.  Initially, our backend team's primary technology stack was `PHP`. Due to business growth requirements, we underwent a microservices transformation. The first version of microservices used `PHP` + `JsonRpc` for communication.
2.  As projects multiplied, the company formed its own `DevOps` team, shifting the underlying deployment to `Docker` + `Kubernetes` container architecture, and introduced the `Golang` technology stack.
3.  Due to several pain points, after comparing `PHP` and `Golang` for a period, the team decided to quickly transition to the `Golang` stack. The main pain points were:
    1.  `PHP` projects had higher overall development and maintenance costs in later stages when business logic became complex. This was mainly due to its excessive flexibility, unstructured variable design, and varying developer skill levels.
    2.  After cloud containerization deployment, `PHP`'s `DevOps` efficiency was too low. Complex `Composer` version management and oversized `Docker` images affected `DevOps` efficiency. In comparison, `Golang` is extremely efficient.
    3.  While the `JsonRpc` communication protocol design offered high interface extensibility and flexibility, it was difficult to quickly determine interface input and output definitions between services, relying solely on documentation and examples for integration and maintenance. Due to the separation of code and documentation, interface documentation often lagged behind interface changes. As services increased, the unstructured communication protocol management further raised the development and maintenance costs of service interfaces.
    4.  The `JsonRpc` communication protocol, essentially based on `HTTP1.x` + `Json`, had low execution efficiency and couldn't be considered a true microservice communication protocol, making it difficult to integrate with mainstream service governance frameworks. In contrast, the `HTTP2.x`-based `gRPC` protocol comes with mature microservice development frameworks and service governance solutions.
    5.  From a business perspective, the migration from `PHP` to `Golang` stack presented an opportunity for technical reconstruction, allowing us to review business system design and pay off technical debt during the process.

Further Pain Points
------

`Golang` is indeed simple enough, and compared to other interpreted languages, it doesn't have excessive syntactic sugar and language features, which allowed our team to quickly get started and complete the technical reconstruction of some business systems. However, this was followed by more serious pain points. Here are the main ones:

1.  **Too Many Reinvented Wheels:** `Golang` is so simple that our team members unleashed their long-suppressed creative energy, fully embracing the "build and forget" mentality, developing/encapsulating numerous wheels of various sizes. These wheels could meet basic functionalities, such as logging, configuration, caching, etc. However, building a wheel is not just about implementing basic functionality as a half-finished product - it needs to ensure functionality, stability, extensibility, and maintainability. It should be validated through more production practices and requires long-term maintenance and continuous iterative improvements. Otherwise, they are just a collection of mismatched tools. Building wheels might feel good momentarily, but maintenance becomes a nightmare. Even now, we are still painfully working on unifying dozens of these scattered tools across more than `100` `Golang` projects. Of course, this issue is also closely related to organizational structure and team management.
2.  **Lack of Systematic Approach:**
    1.  We firmly believed in the principle of one `package` doing one thing, and specifically used **single repository packages** for package management, meaning each `package` was maintained as an independent `git` repository. In reality, there was no necessity for **single repository packages** and such `package` design; instead, independent single repository packages increased the maintenance cost of components and frameworks.
    2.  This single repository package design made it difficult to form a cohesive technical system and establish a unified technical framework for team management. Single repository packages appeared isolated, while building a technical system requires not only establishing standards and specifications but also needs a technical framework for accurate implementation. A systematic, unified technical framework involves at least dozens of basic technical components and cannot be designed in complete isolation. While implementing basic functionality in each `package` is simple, organizing them cohesively is not an easy task. This requires technical managers with deep technical knowledge, vision, and foresight, rather than having the limited perspective of ordinary developers who only focus on individual `packages`.
    3.  This isolated single repository package design provided weak standardization constraints for business projects, as each component could be independently replaced, which exacerbated the issues mentioned in point 1 (we even had several logging components, though they all met basic logging specification requirements). Eventually, our initially proud single repository package design turned into scattered pieces. For example, even adding standardized trace functionality became extremely costly to implement due to the scattered and inconsistent nature of single repository packages.
    4.  Besides making it difficult to establish a technical system and accurately implement technical specifications, each component was also poorly designed in terms of usability. For example, our logging components, cache components, database components, and HTTP/gRPC Server components all needed to interface with configuration management functionality. Single repository packages needed to ensure low coupling design, so developers had to manually read configurations, convert them to target configuration objects, and inject them into corresponding component initialization methods before using these objects in business logic - steps that were repeated across multiple business projects. Actually, `goframe`'s usability design in this aspect is quite good. While each package is independently designed, under a unified technical framework system, it provides a coupled singleton module that encapsulates commonly used objects, automatically implementing configuration reading, configuration object conversion, configuration object injection, and component object initialization. Developers only need to call a single singleton method. This common singleton module became part of our technical framework system, greatly improving the development and maintenance efficiency of business projects.
3.  **Version Inconsistency:** As business projects continued to multiply, the inconsistency in wheel versions became increasingly apparent. What does version inconsistency mean? Here's an example: We have a wheel called `httpClient` with about `10` versions released; we have more than `100` `Golang` projects, with almost every version being used somewhere. When we submit a `bug fix`, it's difficult to get all projects updated. Similar situations exist with other wheels, and we have dozens of various wheels being used independently across different projects.

After reflection and analysis, we concluded the following points:

1.  The team needs a unified technical framework, not a hodgepodge of single repository packages.
2.  We only need to maintain one framework version, not versions of dozens of single repository packages.
3.  Framework components must be modular and loosely coupled, ensuring internal components can also be used independently.
4.  Core components must strictly prohibit single repository package design and must be maintained uniformly by the framework.

The Final Choice
-----

After taking so many detours, we were determined to establish a systematic `Golang` development framework. Beyond requiring quick team learning and low maintenance costs, our primary demand was that core components couldn't be half-finished products - the framework had to be stable, mature, and validated in large-scale production environments. Subsequently, we re-evaluated popular technical frameworks in the industry, including those mentioned above. Our original intention was to unify our internal wheels into a systematic framework while looking for valuable references from open-source projects.

Later, we found `goframe`, and after careful evaluation and study of its framework design, we discovered that its design philosophy aligned perfectly with our experience and conclusions!

Here, I must mention an embarrassing situation. Actually, before switching to `Golang` (mid-2019), we did some research. At that time, `goframe`'s version wasn't very high, and our team members responsible for evaluation had a preconceived notion - seeing so many modules and documentation, they felt it must be complex and probably not performant, so they quickly passed on it without much investigation. Later, we chose some seemingly simple open-source wheels and did our own secondary encapsulation.

This time, after a period of careful research and source code study, we reached a conclusion: `goframe`'s framework architecture, modularization, and engineering design philosophy are excellent, with high execution efficiency. The modules are not only rich but also of remarkably high quality! Compared to our previous half-finished wheels, it's like comparing an apprentice to a master. **It took the team over a year of stumbling through pitfalls to realize that we truly needed a unified technical framework rather than a pile of unsystematic wheels, when in fact, they had already paved a bright path ahead and had been quietly working on it all along.**

After internal team research and discussion, we decided to gradually refactor our business projects using `goframe`. Since `goframe` is modularly designed, we could also make necessary replacements for some modules. The refactoring process went smoothly - restructuring the basic technical framework didn't affect business logic. Instead, through `goframe`'s engineering philosophy and excellent development toolchain, after unifying our technical framework, we greatly improved project development and maintenance efficiency, allowing the team to focus on business development. The department has also subsequently achieved more output. Currently, we have migrated most of our business projects to `goframe`. Our platform handles tens of millions of daily traffic.

Finally, we thank the open-source authors for their quiet contributions! We are also working to encourage our team to embrace the spirit of sourcing from and giving back to the community, and we will participate more in community contributions in the future.
