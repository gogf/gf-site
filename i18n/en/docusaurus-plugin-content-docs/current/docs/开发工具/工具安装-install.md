## Usage

Project address: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/cmd/gf](https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/cmd/gf)

Usage: `./gf install`

This command is usually executed after the `gf` command line tool is downloaded locally (note execution permissions), to install the `gf` command into directories supported by the default system environment variables, so that the `gf` tool can be used anywhere in the system.

:::note
Some systems require administrator permissions.

If users under `MacOS` using `zsh` encounter alias conflicts, it can be resolved by `alias gf=gf`. After running once, the `gf` tool will automatically modify the alias settings in the profile, and users can just re-login (or reopen the terminal).

```bash
$ ./gf_darwin_amd64 install
