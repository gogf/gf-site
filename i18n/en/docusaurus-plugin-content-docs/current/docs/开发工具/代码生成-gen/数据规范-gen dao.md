The `gen dao` command is one of the most frequently used commands in `CLI` and is also a key command for the accurate implementation of the framework's engineering specifications. This command is used to generate `dao` data access objects, `do` data transformation models, and `entity` instance data model `Go` code files. Due to the numerous parameters and options of this command, we recommend using a configuration file to manage generation rules.

    gf gen dao -p ./model -g user-center -t user,user_detail,user_login
    gf gen dao -r user_

CONFIGURATION SUPPORT
    Options are also supported by configuration file.
    It's suggested using configuration file instead of command line arguments making producing.
    The configuration node name is "gfcli.gen.dao", which also supports multiple databases, for example(config.yaml):
    gfcli:
      gen:
        dao:
        - link:     "mysql:root:12345678@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/test"
          tables:   "order,products"
          jsonCase: "CamelLower"
        - link:   "mysql:root:12345678@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/primary"
          path:   "./my-app"
          prefix: "primary_"
          tables: "user, userDetail"
          typeMapping:
            decimal:
              type:   decimal.Decimal
              import: github.com/shopspring/decimal
            numeric:
              type: string
```
:::tip
If you are using the project engineering scaffold recommended by the framework and have the `make` tool installed on your system, you can also use the `make dao` shortcut command.

## Configuration Example

`/hack/config.yaml`

```yaml
gfcli:
  gen:
    dao:
    - link:     "mysql:root:12345678@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/test"
      tables:   "order,products"
      jsonCase: "CamelLower"

    - link:   "mysql:root:12345678@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/primary"
      path:   "./my-app"
      prefix: "primary_"
      tables: "user, userDetail"

    # sqlite requires self-compilation with sqlite driver. Download the library code and modify the import package in the file path (gf\cmd\gf\internal\cmd\cmd_gen_dao.go), uncomment to use. sqlite driver depends on gcc.

## Usage Example

Repository address: [https://github.com/gogf/focus-single](https://github.com/gogf/focus-single)

![Usage Example](/markdown/a02af38b70bb31224361565570e40789.png)

1. The following `3` directories' files are generated by the `dao` command:

| Path | Description | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/internal/dao` | Data Operation Object | Access the underlying data source through object-oriented methods, based on the `ORM` component. Often used in conjunction with `entity` and `do`. Developers can extend and modify the files in this directory, but it is usually unnecessary. |
| `/internal/model/do` | Data Transformation Model | Used for the transformation of business models to data models, maintained by the tool and should not be modified by users. The tool will overwrite the code files in this directory every time it generates code. For more information on `do` files, please refer to:<br />- [Data Model and Business Model](../../Framework Design/Engineering Development Design/Data Model and Business Model.md)<br />- [DAO-Engineering Pain Points and Improvements](../../Framework Design/Engineering Development Design/DAOå°è£ Design/DAO-Engineering Pain Points and Improvements.md)<br />- [Using Pointer Attributes and Do Objects to Implement Flexible Modification Interfaces](../../Core Components/Database ORM/ORM Best Practices/Using Pointer Attributes and Do Objects to Implement Flexible Modification Interfaces.md) |
| `/internal/model/entity` | Data Model | Maintained by the tool and should not be modified by users. The tool will overwrite the code files in this directory every time it generates code. |

2. The models in `model` are divided into two categories: **Data Models** and **Business Models**.

**Data Models:** Automatically generated by the `CLI` tool in the `model/entity` directory files, all database data tables will be generated under this directory, and the models corresponding to the files in this directory are data models. Data models are data structures that correspond one-to-one with data tables. Developers often do not need to modify and should not modify them. Data models are only automatically updated when the data table structure changes through the `CLI` tool. Data models are generated and maintained by the `CLI` tool.

**Business Models:** Business models are data structures related to business, defined as needed, such as input and output data structure definitions of `service`, internal data structure definitions, etc. Business models are defined and maintained by developers according to business needs and are defined in the `model` directory.

3. The files in `dao` are named according to the data table name, one file per data table and one corresponding `DAO` object. Operating on data tables is achieved through `DAO` objects and related operational methods. `dao` operations are designed in a standardized manner, requiring the transmission of a `ctx` parameter, and objects must be created through `Ctx` or `Transaction` methods in the generated code for chain operations on data tables.

## Notes

### Database Types That Require Manual Compilation

The `gen dao` command, when involving code generation related to data access, supports several common types of databases by default. If you need support for the `Oracle` database type, developers need to modify the source code file themselves and then compile and generate the `CLI` tool locally for installation, as the drivers for these databases require `CGO` support and cannot be pre-compiled for direct use.

![Manual Compilation](/markdown/7f849959c13d224393b93d6b371e8ae0.png)

### Regarding `bool` Type Corresponding to Data Table Fields

Since most database types do not have a `bool` type for data table fields, we recommend using `bit(1)` as a substitute for the `bool` type. The `gen dao` command will automatically recognize `bit(1)` data table fields and generate properties of type `bool`. In addition, we do not recommend using `tinyint(1)` as a `bool` type.

For example, table fields:
