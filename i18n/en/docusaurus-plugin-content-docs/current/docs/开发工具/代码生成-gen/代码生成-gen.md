:::info
Starting from version `v2`, the latest features of the `CLI` tool are compiled with the latest version of the `GoFrame` framework. If there is a compatibility issue between the locally automated `CLI` tool-generated code and the project's `GoFrame` framework version, it is recommended to upgrade the project framework version or install an older version of the `CLI` tool. For instructions on installing older versions of the `CLI` tool, please refer to the repository's homepage: [https://github.com/gogf/gf-cli](https://github.com/gogf/gf-cli).

## Important Information ðŸ”¥

- The code generation feature provided by the `CLI` tool aims to **standardize project code writing**, **simplify project development complexity**, and allow developers to **focus on business logic**.
- There will be a learning curve associated with the `CLI` tool (understanding why it's necessary), but once proficient, it will greatly increase development efficiency.
- The code generation feature of the `CLI` tool is particularly beneficial for enterprise-level projects and multi-member team projects. However, for individual small projects, developers can choose whether to use it based on personal preference. The `GoFrame` framework itself provides basic components with a flexible design and does not impose strict requirements on project code; but the `CLI` tool has certain restrictions to ensure consistency in pace and style among team members, preventing overly casual code writing.
