## Basic Introduction

Due to its modular design approach, the `GoFrame` framework can be used both as a utility library and for the complete development of business projects.

Considering that most users employ the framework for developing business projects (microservices), the framework also provides some designs and practices for project development, making it ready to use out of the box.

## Precautions

Project development design is a complex "discipline". Different teams have different design styles, and in some scenarios, it is even closely related to the preferences of the team `leader`.

The project development design provided on the framework's official website is based on the author's experience in writing this section, as well as the pitfalls encountered through `Go` practice projects. It can help you solve common project development challenges, but we do not believe it can meet the preferences of all development teams.

Understanding the background and thought process behind each design section here is more valuable than directly using the framework's components and tools.
