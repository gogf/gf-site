In the previous chapter [Code Layering Design](/docs/design/project-laye), the concept of "**Model**" was mentioned.

This chapter focuses on introducing the definition of models in `GoFrame` and their corresponding management.

## 1. Data Models

**Data Models**, also known as **Entity Models**, primarily originate from the data structures of underlying persistent databases, such as `MySQL`, `Redis`, `MongoDB`, `Kafka`, etc. These data structures are maintained by third-party systems and can be identified through tools to automatically generate corresponding program data model code. The code for these data models is located in the `/internal/model/entity` directory. Developers do not need to manually maintain data models in the program; in the `GoFrame` framework standards, data models are uniformly maintained using `CLI` tools, with code generated automatically.

## 2. Business Models

Business models mainly include two types: **Interface Input/Output Models** and **Business Input/Output Models**.

### Interface Input/Output Models

Interface input/output models are used for system/service interface interactions and are defined in the `api` interface layer for all levels of the project to call. For example, `controller, logic, model` can all call the input/output models of the `api` layer, but the `api` layer is only used for interface interactions with external services, and this model cannot call or reference internal models such as `model` models. In the `GoFrame` framework standards, these input/output models are named in the format `XxxReq` and `XxxRes`.

### Business Input/Output Models

**Business Input/Output Models** are used for method call interactions between **internal** modules/components of the service, especially between `controller->service` or `service->service` calls. These models are defined in the `model` model layer. In the `GoFrame` framework standards, these input/output models are usually named in the format `XxxInput` and `XxxOutput`.

### Special Business Model `DO`

In `GoFrame`, there is a special type of business model `DO` (Data Object) that lies between business models and data models, primarily used in conjunction with the framework's powerful `ORM` component to greatly simplify `DAO` data access operations.

DO is mainly used for DAO data access operations

## 3. Other Models

There are also internal private models used for internal module calls, such as models defined within each business module of `logic` for internal logic and not exposed externally.
