## Introduction

The support of the code framework for microservice projects is achieved through **basic components, development specifications, and development tools**.

The framework supports the development of microservice projects, but as a code development framework, it has its responsibility boundaries. The following microservice-related content is not involved in the code framework:

- CICD
- Service governance
- Monitoring and alerting
- Specific technical solutions. Such as service layering, service splitting, log collection, distributed locks, distributed caches, distributed transactions, etc.
- Data service selection. Such as choosing which message queue service to use, decisions should be made based on specific business scenarios.

In the figure below, the green part represents microservice-related components, and the other parts represent the basic components and development tools that have been implemented. All components of the framework are designed with interfaces to ensure good scalability.

### Interface Protocols

Microservices do not restrict the communication protocols between services. For example, most are based on HTTP, and in the Golang development language stack, most are based on gRPC.

### Interface Adaptation

Regardless of the communication protocol used at the upper layer, the framework provides components and tools related to interface adaptation, shielding the differences in interface protocols and converting various protocols before entering the framework into the internal interface format of the framework. Adaptation to different upper-layer interface protocols is achieved through tools (code generation), and no changes are needed in the internal business interfaces and business logic code of the framework. At the same time, since the upper-layer interface protocols are converted to internal interface formats, the framework can provide unified interface documentation for different protocols.

### Service Components

The framework provides commonly used core basic components related to microservices. Service components are designed with interfaces in the main library of the framework to ensure the lightweight and decoupling design of the main library, and specific implementation logic is provided through community components.

### Core Components

The core components of the framework are the lowest-level project components used to build upper-layer service components or business components.

### Data Services

At the bottom of the service are various data services, such as MySQL, MongoDB, and other data storage, or Kafka, RocketMQ, and other message queues.
