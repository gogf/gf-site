Next, we'll register the user microservice with `etcd` to make it available for other services to call.

Add a configuration file with the `etcd` access address.

*app/user/manifest/config/etcd.yaml*
```yaml
etcd:  
  address: "srv.com:2379"
```

Add the registration logic in the entry file:

*app/user/main.go*
```go
package main  
  
import (  
    _ "github.com/gogf/gf/contrib/drivers/mysql/v2"  
    
    "github.com/gogf/gf/contrib/registry/etcd/v2"  
    "github.com/gogf/gf/contrib/rpc/grpcx/v2"  
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"  
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gctx"  
      
    "proxima/app/user/internal/cmd"
)
  
func main() {  
    var ctx = gctx.New()  
    conf, err := g.Cfg("etcd").Get(ctx, "etcd.address")  
    if err != nil {  
       panic(err)  
    }  
  
    var address = conf.String()  
    grpcx.Resolver.Register(etcd.New(address))  
  
    cmd.Main.Run(ctx)  
}
```

In fact, the key code for service registration is just one line, while the rest is code for reading the configuration file:
```go
grpcx.Resolver.Register(etcd.New(address))
```

Restart the project to apply the changes. Then enter the `etcd` container and execute the following command to verify the registration:
```bash
$ etcdctl get "" --prefix --keys-only
```

This command shows all existing `keys` in `etcd`, where we should see our registered service:
```text
/service/default/default/user/latest/{IP}:32001
```

> Service registration can be understood as similar to DNS name resolution. The service name `grpc.name` in the configuration file can be thought of as analogous to a domain name.
