description: "A guide on initializing the API Gateway, including creating the gateway service using GoFrame CLI and setting up the project structure."
---

The API Gateway is similar to a monolithic web service, with the main difference being that the concrete business logic is now implemented through microservice calls.

## Code Initialization
---
Execute the following command to create a service named `gateway` in the `app` directory.

```bash
$ gf init app/gateway -a
initializing...
initialization done! 
you can now run "cd app/gateway && gf run main.go" to start your journey, enjoy!
```

Remove the following files to start with a clean environment:
```text
app/word/api/*
app/word/internal/controller/*
app/word/internal/cmd/cmd.go
```

Navigate to the repository to begin development:
```bash
$ cd app/gateway
