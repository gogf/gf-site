## Simplified Code Examples
---
If you're reading this book, you're likely already an experienced developer. Therefore, I'll minimize unnecessary verbosity and skip non-essential code details, **focusing primarily on the microservices development process and its key features.**

## Command Line Usage
---
Throughout this book, I'll use the `$` symbol as a command prompt - you don't need to type this symbol. For example, if you see `$ echo "Hello, GoFrame!"`, you should only type `echo "Hello, GoFrame!"`.

```bash
$ echo "Hello, GoFrame!"
Hello, GoFrame!
```

## Code Omissions
---
To keep the content concise and clean, I'll use `...` to indicate omitted code in vertical code blocks.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

...

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello GoFrame")
}

...
