## Introduction
---
The **Proxima Notebook** is an intermediate-level practical tutorial for GoFrame. Unlike the beginner-level tutorial [Starbook](../starbook/starbook.md), this book focuses primarily on **microservices** development.

## Motivation
---
Many online tutorials overwhelm readers with technical jargon, complex architectural layers, and intimidating explanations. After spending hours reading through numerous articles, developers often find themselves unable to write a single line of code.

As the saying goes, "Hearing is not as good as seeing, seeing is not as good as doing." Hands-on practice is the best way to master microservices. This book takes you on a journey from the basics of the `GoFrame` framework to building a real microservices project, demystifying the process along the way. You'll discover that developing microservices isn't as complicated as it seems. The real complexity lies not in the development itself, but in microservices governance.

Our goal is to share professional, practical programming tips and experiences through a project-based approach, helping you achieve real mastery!

## Target Audience
---
This book is designed for developers who are already familiar with `GoFrame` and want to advance their skills in microservices development.

## Troubleshooting
---
Encountering problems during development is normal. The key is knowing how to solve them. When facing issues, try to resolve them independently first. Consulting the `GoFrame` documentation and using search engines are excellent problem-solving approaches. If you still can't find a solution, feel free to contact me, and I'll do my best to help.
