# HTTP Server File Upload

Code Source: https://github.com/gogf/examples/tree/main/httpserver/upload-file



## Description

This example demonstrates how to implement file upload functionality in a HTTP server using `GoFrame`. It showcases:
- A modern and user-friendly file upload interface
- Server-side file upload handling
- Progress tracking for file uploads
- Proper error handling and validation
- Maximum file size configuration

The example provides both a REST API endpoint and a web interface for file uploads.

## Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.22 or higher
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [GoFrame](https://goframe.org)

## Structure

- `go.mod`: The Go module file for dependency management.
- `go.sum`: The Go module checksum file.
- `main.go`: The main application entry point that implements the file upload server.
- `static/`: Directory containing static web files
  - `index.html`: A modern web interface for file uploads with progress tracking.

The project is organized as follows:
```
upload-file/
├── go.mod           # Go module definition
├── go.sum           # Go module checksums
├── main.go          # Server implementation
└── static/          # Static web assets
    └── index.html   # Upload interface
```

## Features

- Modern web interface for file uploads
- Progress bar for upload tracking
- Support for large file uploads (up to 600MB)
- File validation and error handling
- Optional message attachment with uploads
- Access log enabled for debugging
- Clean API documentation

## Usage

1. Run the example:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

2. The server will start at http://127.0.0.1:8199

3. Access the upload interface:
   - Web Interface: http://127.0.0.1:8199/
   - API Endpoint: POST http://127.0.0.1:8199/upload

4. Upload files using either:
   - The web interface by selecting a file and clicking "Upload"
   - Using curl:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8199/upload \
          -F "file=@/path/to/your/file" \
          -F "msg=Optional message"
     ```

## Implementation Details

The example implements several key features:
1. A modern HTML/CSS/JS frontend for file uploads
2. Server-side file handling using GoFrame's features
3. Progress tracking for large file uploads
4. Proper error handling and validation

Key components:
- Maximum file size limit of 600MB
- Access logging for debugging
- Clean separation of frontend and backend code
- Type-safe request/response structures

## Notes

- The maximum file size is set to 600MB
- Access logs are enabled for debugging
- The server supports multipart/form-data uploads
- Frontend provides visual feedback during uploads
- All uploads are validated server-side
